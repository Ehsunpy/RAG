*Many patients will not require a new plan after their initial plan has been prepared. A new plan should not be prepared unless clinically required, and generally not within 12 months of a previous plan. Ongoing management can be provided through the GP Mental Health Treatment Consultation and standard consultation items, as required, and reviews of progress through the GP Mental Health Treatment Plan Review item. A rebate for preparation of a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan will not be paid within 12 months of a previous claim for the patient for the same or another Mental Health Treatment Plan item or within three months following a claim for a GP Mental Health Treatment Review (item 277), other than in exceptional circumstances.

- +The recommended frequency for the review service, allowing for variation in patients' needs, is:
- an initial review, which should occur between four weeks to six months after the completion of a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan; and
- if required, a further review can occur three months after the first review.

In general, most patients should not require more than two reviews in a 12-month period, with ongoing management through the GP Mental Health Treatment Consultation and standard consultation items, as required.

## Practice incentive payments - summary

Apply for the Practice Incentives Program - Health professionals - Services Australia (in bulk or / individual incentive)

Some PIP payments are based on a measure of the practice size, known as the Standardised Whole Patient Equivalent (SWPE) value. The SWPE value is a calculation of practice size. It is based on Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) services all general practitioners and nurse practitioners provide in the practice.

The SWPE value includes Medicare and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) services provided to patients during the reference period. This is a rolling, historical, 12-month period. It starts 16 months before the payment quarter.

The amount paid to each eligible general practice depends on the following factors:

- Practice size measured in Standardised Whole Patient Equivalent (SWPE);
- practice location;
- type of practice;
- type of eligible health professionals engaged;
- average weekly hours worked by eligible health professionals at the practice over the quarter; and
- loadings applicable (loading by MM region and DVA concession status)

Please note: A 50% increase is applied to the SWPE values of Aboriginal Medical Services and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services.

## Indicative payment amounts and rural loadings

A practice may be eligible to receive incentive payments of up to $130,000 per year per practice (before rural loadings and indexation are applied). Indexation will be applied each year from 2024-25, starting in August 2024.
