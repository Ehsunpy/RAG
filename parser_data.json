Should a medical practitioner other than the patient's 'usual doctor' or practice nurse undertake the health assessment, a copy of the health assessment record should be forwarded to the patient's 'usual doctor' or practice, subject to the agreement of the patient or their parent/guardian.\n- Items 701,703,705 and 707 may be used to undertake a health assessment. Item 699 used for heart health assessment\n- Item 10990 or 10991 (bulk billing incentives) can be claimed in conjunction with any health assessment, provided the conditions of item 10990 and 10991 are satisfied.\n- Medical practitioners should establish a register of patients who require annual health assessments and remind these patients when their next health assessment is due. If an assessment identifies that a patient has a chronic medical complex care needs, it may be appropriate for the GP to involve other health professionals in the patient's care using the MBS Chronic Disease Management items.\n\n## Health assessment item numbers\n\n|   Item | Name                                                                                                         | Description / recommended frequency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    701 | Brief Health Assessment <30mins                                                                              | Professional attendance by a general practitioner to perform: \u2022 Collection of relevant information, including taking a patient history and A basic physical examination \u2022 initiating interventions and referrals as indicated and \u2022 providing the patient with preventive health care advice and information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|    703 | Standard Health Assessment 30-44 minutes                                                                     | Professional attendance by a general practitioner to perform: \u2022 Detailed information collection, including taking a patient history and an extensive physical examination \u2022 initiating interventions and referrals as indicated and \u2022 Providing a preventive health care strategy for the patient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|    705 | Long Health Assessment 45-59 minutes                                                                         | Professional attendance by a general practitioner to perform: \u2022 Comprehensive information collection, including taking a patient history \u2022 An extensive examination of the patient's medical condition physical function \u2022 Initiating interventions and referrals as indicated;
