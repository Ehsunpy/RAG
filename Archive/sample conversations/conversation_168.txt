CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been having a tough time managing my pain and mental health. It feels like everything's a bit overwhelming right now.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's break this down and see how we can manage everything effectively. Could you tell me a bit about the pain you're experiencing?

**Patient:** Sure. I've had chronic lower back pain for years, but it seems to be getting worse. It radiates down my left leg and some days it's hard to even get out of bed.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain on average?

**Patient:** It fluctuates, but I'd say it averages around a 7. Some days are worse, like an 8 or 9.

**Doctor:** I see. And how does this pain affect your daily activities?

**Patient:** It limits me a lot. I can't stand or sit for long periods, and it's affecting my sleep. I also feel more anxious and down because of it.

**Doctor:** These are all interconnected, aren't they? Chronic pain can certainly impact mental health. Have you noticed any specific triggers or activities that worsen the pain?

**Patient:** Sitting at my desk at work seems to make it worse, and sometimes even just walking can be painful.

**Doctor:** It's important to address both the physical and mental aspects. Before we delve deeper into the mental health side, let's examine your back. Could you please stand up and show me where the pain is most intense?

**Patient:** Sure. It's mostly here, in the lower back, and it shoots down my left leg.

**Doctor:** (Conducts physical examination) Does this hurt? How about this? Any numbness or tingling in your legs?

**Patient:** Yes, that's quite painful. And yes, sometimes there is tingling, especially when the pain is really bad.

**Doctor:** Thank you. Based on your symptoms, it seems we might be dealing with sciatica, possibly due to a herniated disk. But we need to confirm this with imaging. Now, let's talk about your mental health. How have you been feeling emotionally?

**Patient:** I feel quite anxious and sometimes depressed. I worry about my pain and how it's affecting my life. It's hard to stay positive.

**Doctor:** It's understandable. Chronic pain and mental health often go hand in hand. Have you previously seen a mental health professional?

**Patient:** Yes, I've seen a psychologist off and on for a couple of years.

**Doctor:** That's good to hear. We'll need to integrate that into your management plan. Are you currently on any medications for your mental health or pain?

**Patient:** I'm taking an antidepressant, sertraline, and I use over-the-counter pain relief, but it's not enough.

**Doctor:** Sertraline can be helpful, but we might need to adjust your treatment for both pain and mental health. I'm considering a multidisciplinary approach. Let me explain my thought process: For your back pain, physical therapy might help, along with a referral to a pain specialist. They might consider nerve blocks or other interventions. Meanwhile, a psychiatrist could assess whether your current medication regimen is optimal or if adjustments are needed.

**Patient:** That makes sense. I'm willing to try anything that could help.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I'll also refer you for an MRI to understand the cause of your back pain better. For your mental health, we can look into cognitive-behavioral therapy, which has been effective in managing pain-related anxiety and depression. Does that sound good?

**Patient:** Yes, that sounds like a comprehensive plan. Thank you.

**Doctor:** Now, let's discuss the Medicare Benefits Schedule or MBS. Given the complexity of your case, I believe we should consider billing a Level C consultation, which covers consultations lasting 20 minutes or more with complex decision-making. Additionally, because of the mental health component, we can look into a Mental Health Treatment Plan. This allows for additional support and rebates for psychological services.

**Patient:** I appreciate you explaining that. It's good to know what options are available.

**Doctor:** My pleasure. I'll prepare the necessary referrals and documentation, and we'll set up a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your MRI results and see how you're doing with the new treatment plan. How does that sound?

**Patient:** That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mrs. Thompson. We'll work through this together. Take care and see you soon.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. See you soon.
