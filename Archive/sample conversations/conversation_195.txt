CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?

**Patient:** Good morning, doctor. To be honest, I’ve been better. It’s a bit of a struggle managing everything at once.

**Doctor:** I understand. Let’s unpack that a bit. I see from your file that you’ve been dealing with chronic back pain, and I believe there are some mental health concerns as well. Could you tell me more about how you’re feeling and how these issues are affecting your daily life?

**Patient:** Well, the back pain is pretty constant. It makes it hard to get a good night's sleep, which leaves me feeling exhausted and a bit down most days. I’ve also been feeling more anxious lately, and sometimes I think the stress makes the pain worse.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. Chronic pain can indeed have a significant impact on mental health. Let’s discuss each aspect a bit more. For the back pain, can you describe the pain intensity on a scale from 1 to 10, and does it vary at different times of the day?

**Patient:** It’s usually around a 6 or 7 most of the day. Mornings are the worst, probably because of how I sleep. By the evening, if I’ve been moving around a lot, it might spike to an 8.

**Doctor:** And have you noticed any particular activities or positions that worsen or alleviate the pain?

**Patient:** Sitting for too long, especially at my desk, really aggravates it. Walking helps a bit, but I can’t do it for too long before it starts hurting more. Lying down with a pillow under my knees helps sometimes.

**Doctor:** I see. We’ll definitely need to address that. Now, regarding your mental health, you mentioned anxiety. How often are you experiencing these feelings, and what are some specific triggers you’ve noticed?

**Patient:** The anxiety is pretty frequent, almost daily. It’s worse when I’m under pressure at work or if I haven’t slept well. It feels like everything is piling up, and I just can’t catch a break.

**Doctor:** That’s understandable. Anxiety can often exacerbate chronic pain, creating a bit of a cycle. Have you noticed any impact on your mood or any depressive symptoms?

**Patient:** Yes, I do feel low quite often, especially when the pain keeps me from doing things I enjoy or even just simple tasks. It’s frustrating and makes me feel pretty down.

**Doctor:** Thank you for sharing that. It’s important to tackle these issues together. Let’s perform a quick physical examination to assess your musculoskeletal concerns more closely.

**[The doctor proceeds with a physical examination, checking posture, spinal alignment, range of motion, and any tender points in the back.]**

**Doctor:** Based on the examination, it seems like you have quite a bit of tension in your lower back. We’ll need to focus on some strategies to help alleviate that. I’d like to discuss a comprehensive management plan that addresses both the physical and mental health aspects.

**Patient:** That sounds good. I’m open to suggestions.

**Doctor:** For your back pain, I recommend starting with a tailored physiotherapy program focusing on improving your posture and strengthening your core muscles. This can help reduce strain on your back. I’ll also prescribe a short course of anti-inflammatory medication to manage the pain more effectively.

**Patient:** Will the physio help with the pain long-term?

**Doctor:** Yes, with consistent effort, physiotherapy can significantly improve your back pain. It’s important to incorporate these exercises into your daily routine. For the anxiety and mental health concerns, I suggest cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s very effective in managing anxiety and mood disorders. I can refer you to a psychologist who specializes in chronic pain management.

**Patient:** I’ve never tried therapy before, but I’m willing to give it a go.

**Doctor:** That’s great to hear. Therapy can provide you with strategies to cope with stress and anxiety, which in turn can help manage your pain. I’ll also review your current medications. Sometimes adjusting them can improve both pain and mood symptoms.

**Patient:** I appreciate that. How often should I come back to see you?

**Doctor:** Let’s schedule a follow-up in four weeks to assess your progress with the physiotherapy and the therapy sessions. If necessary, we can adjust your treatment plan. Now, let’s discuss the billing. Given the complexity of managing multiple conditions, we’ll be using a few different MBS item numbers. For today’s consultation, I’ll use item 36, which covers a consultation lasting more than 20 minutes with complex decision-making. For the mental health care plan, we’ll use item 2715, which allows us to coordinate care with a psychologist.

**Patient:** Thanks for explaining that. I wasn’t sure how it all worked.

**Doctor:** No problem at all. It’s important for you to understand each step. We’re here to support you in managing these conditions effectively. If you have any questions or concerns before the next appointment, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

**Patient:** I will. Thank you for your help today, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care, and we’ll see you in a few weeks.
