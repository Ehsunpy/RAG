CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How have you been feeling since our last visit?

**Patient:** Morning, Doctor. It’s been a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. My back pain has been flaring up more often, and it’s starting to wear on me mentally. I've also been feeling more anxious lately, which doesn’t help.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let’s start by discussing your back pain. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain today?

**Patient:** Today, it’s around a 7. It’s been hovering between 6 and 8 most days.

**Doctor:** That sounds quite uncomfortable. Is the pain localized to your lower back, or does it radiate elsewhere?

**Patient:** Mostly lower back, but sometimes I feel it in my hips and down my left leg. 

**Doctor:** That sounds like it could be affecting your sciatic nerve. Have you noticed any changes in your mobility or strength?

**Patient:** Yes, it’s definitely harder to move around, especially in the mornings. I also feel weaker in my legs sometimes.

**Doctor:** Let's examine your back and legs to assess any nerve involvement. Please stand up and perform a forward bend as far as you comfortably can.

**Patient:** (Bends forward) It’s tight, but I can manage this. 

**Doctor:** And now, please lean back and tell me if the pain changes.

**Patient:** Leaning back actually makes it worse.

**Doctor:** Alright, now I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. (Performs examination) There’s a slight reduction in reflex on the left side, which aligns with your symptoms. How's the sleeping going? Are you able to rest adequately at night?

**Patient:** Not really. The pain wakes me up a few times, and I toss and turn a lot. My mind races too, which makes it hard to fall back asleep.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. How’s your mood been overall?

**Patient:** Pretty low, to be honest. I’ve been feeling more stressed and anxious, especially with how much the pain limits my daily activities.

**Doctor:** I understand. Chronic pain can significantly affect mental health. It’s crucial we address both simultaneously. Have you been continuing with the mindfulness exercises we discussed last time?

**Patient:** I have, but they don’t seem to be helping as much as they used to.

**Doctor:** It might be time to adjust our approach. Let’s consider integrating a more structured mental health care plan alongside your physical treatment. 

**Patient:** Okay, I’m open to that. What do you suggest?

**Doctor:** For the mental health aspect, I’d recommend starting with a Mental Health Care Plan, which allows us access to psychological services through Medicare. I’ll refer you to a psychologist who specializes in pain management and anxiety, so they can provide tailored cognitive-behavioral strategies.

**Patient:** That sounds good. Do you think medication might help with my anxiety?

**Doctor:** It might be beneficial, especially given the interaction between your chronic pain and anxiety. A low-dose antidepressant could potentially help with both your mood and pain. We’ll need to monitor this closely, so I’ll start with a small dose and we’ll adjust as needed.

**Patient:** Alright. And what about the back pain itself?

**Doctor:** We’ll continue with your current pain management regimen, but I’d like to add a physiotherapy program to improve your mobility and strength. We can explore a pain specialist referral if your symptoms persist.

**Patient:** I’ve tried physiotherapy before, but I didn’t stick with it. Do you think it will really help?

**Doctor:** Consistency is key. I’ll refer you to a physiotherapist who can tailor a program specifically for you. It might be helpful to attend a few sessions to get started and then follow up regularly.

**Patient:** I’ll give it another try. Anything else we should consider?

**Doctor:** Nutrition and lifestyle changes can also play a role in managing your symptoms. I’ll refer you to a dietitian who can help optimize your diet for inflammation and overall health. 

**Patient:** That makes sense. I’m willing to try whatever can help at this point.

**Doctor:** Great. Now, regarding the billing and MBS item numbers, today’s consultation will likely include item 36, which covers a long consultation, and possibly item 2715 for the mental health care plan. We’ll ensure everything is documented correctly to maximize your Medicare benefits.

**Patient:** I appreciate that. Will the referrals be covered too?

**Doctor:** Yes, I’ll make sure the referrals to the psychologist, physiotherapist, and dietitian are under Medicare-supported plans. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to review your progress and any adjustments needed.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I’m hopeful this plan will make a difference.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mr. Johnson. Let’s work together to get you feeling better. See you in four weeks, and don’t hesitate to contact me if anything changes.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks again.

**Doctor:** Take care, and remember, you’re not alone in this. See you soon.
