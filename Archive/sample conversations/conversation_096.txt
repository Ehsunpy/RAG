CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How have you been since our last appointment?

**Patient:** Hello, Doctor. I've been managing, but things have been a bit challenging lately. My back pain hasn't improved much, and I've been feeling more anxious and overwhelmed.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s try to get a handle on everything. Let's start with your back pain. Can you describe how it's been affecting you day-to-day?

**Patient:** The pain is constant, mostly a dull ache but sometimes it gets sharp if I move suddenly. It's in my lower back and sometimes radiates down my left leg. It makes it difficult to sit for long periods, which I have to do for work.

**Doctor:** That sounds uncomfortable. On a scale from 0 to 10, where would you rate your pain on average?

**Patient:** I'd say it's around a 6 most days, but can spike to an 8 if I overdo it.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any particular activities or times of day when it gets worse?

**Patient:** It tends to worsen in the afternoon and if I’ve been sitting too long. Evenings are the worst, as it’s hard to relax and wind down for the night.

**Doctor:** And how have you been managing the pain? Are you using any medications or other treatments?

**Patient:** I’ve been taking the painkillers you prescribed, but I try not to rely on them too much. I also do some stretches and have tried heat packs, but the relief is only temporary.

**Doctor:** Understood. Now, regarding your anxiety, how have your symptoms been manifesting lately?

**Patient:** I've been feeling tense and on edge most of the time. My mind races, and I have trouble concentrating at work. Sleeping has been difficult too; I often lie awake worrying about everything.

**Doctor:** I see. How has this been affecting your daily routine and interactions?

**Patient:** It makes me irritable, and I’ve been avoiding social situations because I just don’t feel up to it. It's tough because it feels like a vicious cycle with the pain and anxiety feeding off each other.

**Doctor:** You're right, chronic pain and anxiety can indeed exacerbate each other. It's important we address these together. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your anxiety?

**Patient:** Stress at work is a big one, and worrying about my health doesn’t help. Sometimes, even small things can set it off.

**Doctor:** Let's conduct a quick physical examination, especially focusing on your back. Please stand up and let me know if anything feels tender or painful as I check your spine and lower back. 

**Patient:** Sure. [Patient stands as Doctor examines.]

**Doctor:** [Gently palpating the lower back.] Let me know if there's any discomfort or sharp pain.

**Patient:** It’s a bit tender on the left side, right there... [winces slightly].

**Doctor:** Noted. Your range of motion seems a bit limited. I suspect there’s some inflammation contributing to the pain. Coupling this with your anxiety, it’s understandable why you’re experiencing increased discomfort.

**Patient:** That makes sense.

**Doctor:** For your back pain, I recommend we adjust your treatment plan. I’ll refer you to a physiotherapist who can guide you on exercises tailored to improve your mobility and pain. We should also consider a different pain management strategy. I’ll prescribe a medication that can help with both pain and anxiety, like duloxetine, which might offer dual benefits.

**Patient:** That sounds helpful. What about my anxiety?

**Doctor:** In addition to the medication, I suggest we initiate a mental health care plan. This will include regular sessions with a psychologist to help you develop coping strategies for anxiety and stress management.

**Patient:** I think that would be really beneficial.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll prepare a mental health care plan today. This will cover a set number of sessions that Medicare can subsidize. Regarding the billing, for today's consultation, we'll use item number 36, given the complexity and duration of our discussion.

**Patient:** Thank you for explaining everything.

**Doctor:** Of course, Mrs. Thompson. We’ll also schedule a follow-up in four weeks to evaluate how you're responding to the new treatments and make any necessary adjustments. If you have any concerns before then, don’t hesitate to reach out.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome. We'll take this step by step and work towards improving your quality of life. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.

**Patient:** Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor.
