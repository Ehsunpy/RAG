CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Sarah. How are you feeling today?

**Patient:** Morning, Dr. Lee. I’m doing okay, but I’ve been having a tough time managing everything. The pain is just... it's a lot.

**Doctor:** I understand. Let's take it one step at a time. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain you're experiencing? Where is it located, and how would you describe it?

**Patient:** It’s mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it radiates down my legs. It’s a sharp, stabbing pain, but there are times when it feels more like a dull ache. It’s been going on for over a year now.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain on average?

**Patient:** On a bad day, it’s probably around an 8. On a better day, maybe a 5 or 6.

**Doctor:** And how often are you experiencing those bad days?

**Patient:** At least three times a week. It’s really affecting my daily life and work.

**Doctor:** I can imagine. Now, let’s talk about your mental health. How have you been feeling emotionally and mentally?

**Patient:** Honestly, not great. I’ve been feeling pretty down. The pain makes it hard to do things I enjoy, and I’ve been feeling more anxious lately. Sometimes, I feel like I can’t keep up with everything.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that, Sarah. It’s not uncommon for chronic pain to impact mental health. Have you noticed if your mood changes with the pain levels?

**Patient:** Yes, definitely. When the pain is worse, I feel more anxious and depressed. It’s like a cycle I can’t break.

**Doctor:** Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s important for us to address both your physical and mental health. Have you had any treatments or medications recently to help with the pain?

**Patient:** I’ve tried physiotherapy, but it didn’t help much. I’m currently on some pain medication, but I’m worried about taking too much.

**Doctor:** I understand your concern. We need to find a balance where we’re managing your pain without relying too heavily on medication. Let’s also consider how your mental health might be contributing to your pain perception. Sometimes anxiety and depression can heighten the sensation of pain.

**Patient:** That makes sense. I hadn’t thought about it like that.

**Doctor:** Let’s do a quick physical examination to see how your back is doing. Could you please stand up and touch your toes, if possible?

**Patient:** Sure, I’ll try. [Patient attempts the movement.]

**Doctor:** Thank you. I can see there’s some limitation in your movement there. Now, let’s check your reflexes and muscle strength. [Performs examination.]

**Doctor:** Your reflexes and muscle strength seem normal, which is a good sign. However, the limitation in movement suggests we need to continue addressing the musculoskeletal issues.

**Patient:** Is there anything else we can do?

**Doctor:** Yes, I think a multidisciplinary approach will be beneficial. This means combining different treatments, like a tailored exercise program, cognitive behavioral therapy for your mental health, and possibly exploring alternative therapies like acupuncture or massage.

**Patient:** That sounds good. I’m open to trying new things.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll refer you to a physiotherapist who can design a specific exercise regimen for you. Meanwhile, I’d like to keep monitoring your mental health. Would you be open to seeing a psychologist?

**Patient:** Yes, I think that could help.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I’ll also prescribe a low-dose antidepressant that can help with both the pain and your mood. It’s been shown to be effective for chronic pain patients with depression or anxiety.

**Patient:** Okay, I’m willing to try that.

**Doctor:** As for the MBS aspect, we’ll be using a few different item numbers today. For this consultation, which was quite detailed, I’ll use item 36, for a long consultation. We’ll also look at item 2715 for developing a mental health care plan, and I can coordinate with your physiotherapist and psychologist using item 10997 for team care arrangements.

**Patient:** That sounds like a lot to keep track of.

**Doctor:** Don’t worry, Sarah. My team and I will handle the logistics. The important thing is that you feel supported and we have a clear plan moving forward. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how everything is progressing.

**Patient:** Thank you, Dr. Lee. I really appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** You’re very welcome. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We’re here to help you every step of the way. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment.

**Patient:** I will. Thanks again.

**Doctor:** Take care, Sarah. We’ll speak soon.
