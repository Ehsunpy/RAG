CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Sarah. How have you been managing since your last visit?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. It's been a bit challenging. I've been feeling more fatigued lately, and my anxiety seems to be getting worse.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Can you tell me more about the fatigue? When did it start, and how is it impacting your daily activities?

**Patient:** It's been gradually getting worse over the last three months. By midday, I feel like I could just fall asleep at my desk. It's hard to focus, and even simple tasks feel overwhelming.

**Doctor:** I see. Are you experiencing any other symptoms like changes in appetite, weight, or sleep patterns?

**Patient:** My appetite is all over the place. Some days I don't want to eat at all, and other days I can't stop snacking. I’ve also gained about 5 kilograms in the last few months. As for sleep, I’m having trouble falling asleep and often wake up during the night.

**Doctor:** That sounds really tough. Let’s talk a little about your anxiety. How have you been managing that?

**Patient:** Not very well, to be honest. I feel anxious most days, and it’s hard to control. I've tried breathing exercises and meditation, but they only help a little.

**Doctor:** It sounds like your anxiety might be contributing to your fatigue and sleep issues. Have you noticed any specific triggers for your anxiety?

**Patient:** Work has been really stressful lately. There are constant deadlines and pressure to perform, and it feels like I can never catch up.

**Doctor:** That’s certainly a lot to handle. Are you experiencing any symptoms like palpitations, sweating, or feeling lightheaded?

**Patient:** Yes, sometimes my heart races, especially when I'm trying to meet a tight deadline or if I feel overwhelmed.

**Doctor:** Thank you for sharing that. I’d like to conduct a physical examination now to check your heart rate, blood pressure, and overall health. Please take off your jacket and roll up your sleeves.

**Patient:** Sure.

**Doctor:** [Performing physical examination] Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 135/85, and your heart rate is a bit fast at 95 beats per minute. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. [Uses stethoscope] Everything sounds normal there. I’ll also examine your thyroid and check for any swelling in your lymph nodes. [Continues examination]

**Doctor:** Everything seems okay with your thyroid and lymph nodes. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like your anxiety and stress are significantly impacting your physical health. Have you been taking any medications for anxiety or any other health issues?

**Patient:** I'm on a low-dose antidepressant, sertraline, which I started about a year ago. I also take metformin for my PCOS.

**Doctor:** Given the persistence of your symptoms, it might be worth considering a consultation with a psychologist or psychiatrist to assess whether your current medication is still suitable or if a different approach might be needed. It might also help to explore cognitive-behavioral therapy to manage your anxiety.

**Patient:** I’ve been thinking about therapy but wasn’t sure where to start.

**Doctor:** I can provide a mental health care plan, which will give you access to Medicare rebates for psychological services. I’ll write a referral for you. Now, regarding your fatigue and weight gain, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions like thyroid dysfunction or anemia.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea.

**Doctor:** I’ll arrange for a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a metabolic panel. We should also check your vitamin D and B12 levels, as deficiencies can contribute to fatigue.

**Patient:** Okay, when should I get these tests done?

**Doctor:** You can have them done at your convenience, but I’d recommend doing it within the next week. Once we have the results, we can decide on the next steps.

**Patient:** Alright, I can do that. 

**Doctor:** In terms of managing your stress, it might be helpful to incorporate some regular physical activity, even just a 20-minute walk each day. Exercise can significantly improve mood and energy levels.

**Patient:** I’ll try to fit that into my routine. I’ve been meaning to get more active.

**Doctor:** Great. Let’s set a follow-up appointment for two weeks from now to discuss your test results and how you’re feeling with any changes. Does that work for you?

**Patient:** Yes, that should be fine.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I’ll prepare the mental health care plan and the pathology request for you before you leave. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and we’ll work through it together.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Sarah. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.

*The doctor proceeds to complete the necessary paperwork, including the mental health care plan and pathology request form, ensuring the patient understands the billing process and any Medicare rebates applicable.*
