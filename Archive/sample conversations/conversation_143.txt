CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How have you been feeling since your last visit?

**Patient:** Morning, Doctor. I've been having a tough time with my back pain, and my mood hasn't been great either. The pain makes it hard to do anything, which is quite frustrating.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's start by discussing your back pain. Could you rate your pain on a scale from 1 to 10, and tell me if there are any specific activities or times of day when it's worse?

**Patient:** I'd say it's about a 7 most of the time, but it spikes to a 9 when I try to do things like walking for more than 10 minutes or bending over. Mornings are the worst—it's like my body's just too stiff to move.

**Doctor:** It sounds quite debilitating. Is there anything that offers you relief, like resting, heat, or over-the-counter medications?

**Patient:** Rest helps a bit, and I've been using a heating pad. But honestly, nothing makes it go away completely. Paracetamol doesn't seem to do much anymore.

**Doctor:** I see. Let's talk about how this is affecting your mental health. You mentioned your mood hasn't been great. Can you tell me more about that?

**Patient:** Well, the constant pain gets me down. I feel like I can't enjoy anything anymore. I've been feeling pretty low, and it's hard to stay positive.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?

**Patient:** My sleep is terrible. I wake up several times a night because of the pain. I still eat okay, but I just feel tired all the time.

**Doctor:** It sounds like the pain is impacting your quality of life significantly. Let's take a look at your back. Could you please stand up and let me know where it hurts the most?

**Patient:** Sure, it's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it shoots down to my legs.

**Doctor:** [Conducts a physical examination, checking range of motion, tenderness, and any neurological deficits.] I can see there's some limited range of motion and tenderness in your lower back. I didn't find any neurological deficits, which is a good sign.

**Patient:** That's a relief, at least.

**Doctor:** Considering your age and the chronicity of your condition, there's likely some interaction between your physical and mental health symptoms. Chronic pain can often lead to mood disturbances, and vice versa. Have you ever tried any psychological therapies or seen a counselor?

**Patient:** No, I haven't. Do you think that would help?

**Doctor:** It could be beneficial. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for instance, is quite effective for managing both chronic pain and depressive symptoms. We could consider a mental health care plan to facilitate this.

**Patient:** Okay, I'm open to trying that.

**Doctor:** In terms of managing your back pain, we should consider a more comprehensive approach. Have you been referred to a physiotherapist or tried any other physical therapies?

**Patient:** No, just the heating pad at home.

**Doctor:** I recommend we start with a physiotherapist. They can guide you through exercises that strengthen your back and improve flexibility. We should also review your medication regimen. Given your pain level, it might be worthwhile to explore options beyond paracetamol, like a trial of a different analgesic or a referral to a pain specialist.

**Patient:** That sounds like a plan. I don't want to rely on too many medications, though.

**Doctor:** That's understandable. We'll aim for a balance. Non-pharmacological strategies will be a key component of your plan. I'll also provide you with some educational resources on self-management techniques for chronic pain.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** Of course. Now, regarding the paperwork, I’m considering a few options for billing today. Given the complexity of managing multiple conditions, I’ll be using MBS item 36 for a long consultation, which covers consultations over 20 minutes. For your mental health care plan, we'll use item 2715. Lastly, if we move forward with the pain management plan, there may be additional items to consider.

**Patient:** That makes sense. I trust your judgment on this.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I'll document everything and provide you with referrals to a physiotherapist and a psychologist. We can review your progress in about four weeks, but if you have any concerns before then, please don't hesitate to contact me.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel better knowing there's a plan in place.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. Let’s tackle this together. I'll see you in a month, and take care in the meantime.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks again.
