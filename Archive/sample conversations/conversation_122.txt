CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good afternoon, Mr. Thompson. How are you today?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. I've been better, to be honest. Just feeling a bit overwhelmed lately.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's go through everything systematically. We have some time together, so let's make sure we cover all your concerns. First, can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you?

**Patient:** Well, there’s a lot going on. I've been trying to manage my diabetes and high blood pressure, but I also feel really anxious and down, especially with everything on my plate.

**Doctor:** I understand. Managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension can be challenging, especially when you're feeling anxious and down. Let's take it step by step. How have your blood sugar levels been recently?

**Patient:** They've been all over the place, really. I try to eat right, but sometimes I just don't have the energy to cook, and I end up eating whatever is quick.

**Doctor:** I see. When you say "all over the place," do you mean they’re mostly high, or are you experiencing lows as well?

**Patient:** Mostly high, but sometimes they drop unexpectedly.

**Doctor:** Okay, let's make sure we address that. How about your blood pressure? Have you been monitoring it at home?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been checking it, and it's usually high. Last time I checked, it was around 145/95.

**Doctor:** Thank you for that information. It’s important we get both your diabetes and hypertension under better control. Now, regarding the anxiety and feeling down, how long have you been feeling this way?

**Patient:** It's been a few months, getting progressively worse. I used to handle stress better, but now I just feel constantly anxious and sometimes hopeless.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. It’s not uncommon for chronic physical health issues to affect mental health. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

**Patient:** Yes, my sleep is quite poor. I wake up multiple times during the night. As for appetite, it's decreased; I don't feel like eating much.

**Doctor:** Those are important symptoms to note. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or that life isn't worth living?

**Patient:** No, nothing like that, but I just feel stuck.

**Doctor:** I’m glad to hear that. It’s good to talk about these feelings because they can really impact your overall health. Let's talk about your preventive health screenings. When was your last check-up for cholesterol, and have you had any recent screenings for colorectal cancer?

**Patient:** I think my cholesterol was checked a year ago, and it was a bit high. I haven't had any colorectal cancer screenings that I can recall.

**Doctor:** At 53, it's important we keep up with those screenings. I’ll arrange a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and a faecal occult blood test, which is a simple screening test for colorectal cancer. Now, let me perform a quick physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, heart, and lungs.

**[Doctor performs the examination]**

**Doctor:** Your blood pressure is indeed elevated at 150/95. Heart and lungs sound normal, though. Given these findings, I think we should adjust your medication. Are you currently taking metformin for your diabetes and amlodipine for your hypertension?

**Patient:** Yes, exactly those.

**Doctor:** We may need to increase the dose of your amlodipine and consider adding another antihypertensive. For diabetes, given your fluctuations, we might need to discuss insulin or another oral agent. We also need to address your mental health. I’d like to refer you to a psychologist for some cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective for anxiety and depression. How does that sound to you?

**Patient:** That sounds good. I've been meaning to talk to someone.

**Doctor:** Great. We’ll also look at starting you on an antidepressant, which can help with both mood and possibly your sleep. I’ll prescribe a low dose of sertraline and we’ll monitor how you respond.

**Patient:** Okay, I’m willing to try it.

**Doctor:** For the billing, given your chronic disease management, preventive health screening, and mental health care, I'll be using the MBS item numbers for a long consultation, chronic disease management plan, and mental health care plan. This will help cover our comprehensive approach today.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. That sounds comprehensive.

**Doctor:** You're welcome. We’ll follow up in about four weeks to see how you’re doing with the new medication regimen and therapy, and we’ll review your blood tests and screening results then as well. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes or you have any concerns before then.

**Patient:** I appreciate it, Doctor. Thank you for your help.

**Doctor:** Anytime, Mr. Thompson. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
