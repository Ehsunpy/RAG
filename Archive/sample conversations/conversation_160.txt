**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been better. I'm here because I'm struggling with managing my diabetes and feeling quite overwhelmed lately.

**Doctor:** I understand. Let's take a comprehensive look at your situation. First, could you tell me a bit more about your diabetes management? How are your blood sugar levels, and what medications are you currently taking?

**Patient:** I've been on Metformin for a couple of years now. Recently, my blood sugars have been all over the place, especially in the mornings. I try to watch my diet, but it's hard with my job.

**Doctor:** It can be challenging to maintain consistency with a busy schedule. How often are you checking your blood sugar levels, and what range are you typically seeing?

**Patient:** I check them every morning and sometimes before dinner. Recently, my morning readings have been around 180 to 200 mg/dL.

**Doctor:** That’s a bit higher than we’d like. Are you experiencing any symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, or any changes in your vision?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been more thirsty and using the bathroom a lot more. My vision's been a bit blurry at times too.

**Doctor:** Okay, we'll need to address these issues to prevent complications. Now, moving on to your mental health concerns, can you describe what’s been overwhelming you?

**Patient:** My work has been extremely stressful, and I'm finding it hard to concentrate. I've been feeling anxious and having trouble sleeping.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever experienced similar symptoms before, or is this a recent development?

**Patient:** I've had bouts of anxiety in the past, but nothing like this. It’s been going on for a few months now.

**Doctor:** Have you tried any coping strategies or sought support from a counselor or therapist?

**Patient:** I haven't seen a therapist yet, but I have been trying some breathing exercises. They help a little, but not enough.

**Doctor:** It’s good that you’re trying those exercises. Let’s look into a referral for a mental health care plan. We can work together to find a strategy that helps you manage both your diabetes and mental health more effectively.

**Patient:** That would be great. I definitely feel like I need some professional help with this.

**Doctor:** Absolutely. Now, I'd like to conduct a physical examination to get a better understanding of your overall health status. Is that okay with you?

**Patient:** Sure, that sounds fine.

**Doctor:** [The doctor conducts a thorough physical examination, checking blood pressure, heart rate, and inspecting the eyes for diabetic retinopathy, as well as looking for signs of peripheral neuropathy.]

**Doctor:** Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. I didn't notice any significant issues with your feet, which is good, but we should keep monitoring them regularly.

**Patient:** Okay, thank you.

**Doctor:** Based on our discussion and examination, here's what I propose: Firstly, we'll adjust your diabetes medication. I’ll prescribe an additional agent to help control your blood sugar levels more effectively. We’ll also set up a referral for a psychologist for cognitive behavioral therapy. Additionally, I’ll give you a mental health care plan, which will allow Medicare to cover some of the costs.

**Patient:** That sounds like a solid plan. I appreciate your help with this.

**Doctor:** It’s my pleasure. We’ll also arrange for a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how the changes are working for you. In the meantime, try to maintain your diet and exercise as much as possible. If you notice any new symptoms or have concerns, please don't hesitate to call.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel more hopeful about managing everything now.

**Doctor:** I’m glad to hear that. Take care, Mr. Thompson. We’ll get through this together.

**Patient:** Thank you. I’ll see you in a month.
