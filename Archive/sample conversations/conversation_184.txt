CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, James. How have you been feeling since our last appointment?

**Patient:** Morning, Doctor. I've been having a bit of a tough time. The fatigue is still there, and I’ve been feeling pretty low on energy. It's hard to stay focused on my studies, and I’ve been feeling anxious more often.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s take a closer look at what’s been going on. Is the fatigue constant, or does it come and go? And how would you rate your energy levels on a scale from 1 to 10?

**Patient:** It’s mostly constant. I’d say my energy is around a 3 or 4 most days. Some days are a little better, but it never goes above a 5.

**Doctor:** I see. Have you noticed any particular activities or times of the day when your energy levels dip further?

**Patient:** It usually gets worse in the afternoons. By 3 or 4 PM, I’m just wiped out. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t rested at all.

**Doctor:** Let’s explore your sleep a bit more. Are you having trouble falling or staying asleep? Any disturbances during the night?

**Patient:** I can fall asleep okay, but I wake up a few times during the night. Sometimes it’s hard to get back to sleep because my mind starts racing.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. How about your appetite? Any changes there?

**Patient:** Yeah, I’m not as hungry as I used to be. I skip meals sometimes because I don’t feel like eating.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any weight changes recently?

**Patient:** I think I’ve lost a couple of pounds, but it’s nothing drastic.

**Doctor:** Understood. Let’s talk a bit about the anxiety. Can you describe what typically triggers those feelings?

**Patient:** It’s mostly when I think about deadlines or social situations. I get this tight feeling in my chest and my heart races. Sometimes it’s hard to breathe.

**Doctor:** Any panic attacks, where you feel overwhelmed by anxiety?

**Patient:** I’ve had a couple in the past month. They usually last about 10 to 15 minutes, but it feels longer.

**Doctor:** That sounds distressing. I’d like to ask about your chronic condition as well. Have there been any changes in your symptoms or how you’re managing it?

**Patient:** My asthma’s been under control for the most part, but I’ve had to use my inhaler more often than I’d like.

**Doctor:** How many times a week are you using your inhaler?

**Patient:** About four or five times a week. Mostly when I’m exercising or if I’m in a place with a lot of dust.

**Doctor:** Let’s make sure we’re managing that effectively. I want to perform a physical examination now. Could you please step over here?

**Patient:** Sure.

**Doctor:** [During the examination] I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take deep breaths in and out for me, please. [Pauses while listening] Good. Your lungs sound clear, which is a good sign. Now, I’ll check your heart rate and blood pressure. [Performs checks] Everything seems normal there. I’m also going to assess your thyroid and check for any gland enlargement. [Checks thyroid] That feels normal too. Finally, I’d like to take a look at your skin and nails for any signs of changes. [Examines skin and nails] Everything looks fine there.

**Patient:** Okay, that’s good to hear.

**Doctor:** Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your chronic fatigue and anxiety might be interconnected, possibly exacerbated by stress and your asthma management. I’d like to adjust your asthma medication to see if it helps with the frequency of your inhaler use and overall energy levels.

**Patient:** That sounds good. What about the anxiety and fatigue?

**Doctor:** For the anxiety, I’d like to refer you to a mental health specialist for cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective. Additionally, I’ll prescribe a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to help manage your anxiety and mood.

**Patient:** Will the SSRI help with the fatigue too?

**Doctor:** It can, especially if the fatigue is related to depression or anxiety. We’ll monitor how you respond to the medication and adjust if needed. I’d also recommend some lifestyle modifications, like regular exercise and a consistent sleep schedule, to help with your energy levels.

**Patient:** Okay, I can try that.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll also arrange for some blood tests to rule out any other conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid dysfunction or iron deficiency. We’ll follow up on those results in about two weeks.

**Patient:** Sounds like a plan. Thank you, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, James. We’ll work together to get you feeling better. If you experience any side effects from the medication or if your symptoms worsen, please contact me right away. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you’re doing.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks again.

**Doctor:** Take care, James. I’ll see you in a few weeks.
