CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. Thank you for coming in today. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's been a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. I've been trying to manage my diabetes and high blood pressure, but I've also been feeling quite anxious lately.

**Doctor:** I understand. Managing multiple chronic conditions can be challenging. Let's start with your diabetes. How have your blood sugar levels been recently?

**Patient:** They've been a bit erratic. Sometimes they're higher than usual, even though I'm sticking to my diet and medication.

**Doctor:** I see. Have you noticed any patterns or specific triggers that might be causing these fluctuations?

**Patient:** Not really, but I have been under a lot of stress at work. Could that be affecting it?

**Doctor:** Absolutely, stress can impact your blood sugar levels. We'll need to look into strategies to manage your stress. But first, let's review your current medications. Are you still taking Metformin and Lisinopril?

**Patient:** Yes, I am. I haven't missed any doses.

**Doctor:** Good to hear. Have you experienced any side effects from these medications?

**Patient:** Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous after taking Metformin, but it's not too bad.

**Doctor:** That's a common side effect. Now, regarding your blood pressure, have you been monitoring it at home?

**Patient:** Yes, I check it every morning. It's been slightly above normal, around 140/90 most days.

**Doctor:** That's higher than we'd like. We'll need to address that. Now, you mentioned feeling anxious. Can you describe what you've been experiencing?

**Patient:** I often feel overwhelmed, and it's hard for me to concentrate. I also have trouble sleeping and feel on edge most of the time.

**Doctor:** How long have you been feeling this way?

**Patient:** It's been about three months now, but it's been getting worse lately.

**Doctor:** Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like palpitations or shortness of breath?

**Patient:** Sometimes I do feel my heart racing, especially when I'm stressed.

**Doctor:** It sounds like anxiety might be contributing to your stress levels, which could, in turn, affect your diabetes and blood pressure. We'll definitely need to address this. Before we proceed, let's do a quick physical examination to check your vitals.

**Doctor:** Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today at 142/92, and your heart rate is 88 beats per minute. Otherwise, everything else seems normal. Given your symptoms, I think we should consider a mental health care plan. How do you feel about talking to a psychologist?

**Patient:** I think that could help. I'm open to it.

**Doctor:** Great. I'll refer you to a psychologist who can work with you on managing your anxiety. In terms of billing, this will involve an MBS item number for your mental health care plan, which is item 2715. I’ll also update your chronic disease management plan, which corresponds to item 732.

**Patient:** Okay, that sounds good. What about my medications?

**Doctor:** For your diabetes, I recommend continuing with Metformin, but I’ll also prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication that can help with both your anxiety and potentially stabilize your blood sugar levels. For your hypertension, we might consider adjusting your Lisinopril dose or adding a diuretic. I’ll have you come back in two weeks for a follow-up to see how you’re responding to these changes.

**Patient:** That sounds like a plan. Do I need to do anything else in the meantime?

**Doctor:** I suggest keeping a log of your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and any anxiety symptoms you experience. This will help us track how you're doing with the new management plan. Also, try to incorporate some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or yoga, to help with your stress.

**Patient:** I can do that. Thank you, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mrs. Thompson. We’ll get through this together. If you have any concerns before your next appointment, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I’ll see you in two weeks.

**Patient:** Thank you. I'll see you then.

**Doctor:** Take care, Mrs. Thompson.
