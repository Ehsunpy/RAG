CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good afternoon, Mr. Thompson. How have you been feeling recently?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. I've been having a tough time managing everything. My back pain has been flaring up again, and it's been hard to keep my mood stable. It feels like everything's piling up on me.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's work through this together. Why don't we start with your back pain? Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp, dull, constant, or intermittent?

**Patient:** It's a dull ache most of the time, but when I try to do something physical, like lifting or even bending down, it turns into a sharp pain. It’s mostly in my lower back and sometimes it radiates down my right leg.

**Doctor:** That sounds difficult. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain on average and during those sharper episodes?

**Patient:** On average, it's about a 5, but when it gets sharp, it can go up to an 8 or 9.

**Doctor:** Okay, and how long have you been experiencing this increased pain?

**Patient:** It's been about three months now. It used to come and go, but recently it's been more persistent.

**Doctor:** I see. Let's also talk about your mental health. You mentioned difficulty keeping your mood stable. Can you expand on that?

**Patient:** Sure. I've been feeling really down and anxious. I think the constant pain is wearing on me, and I just can't seem to shake this cloud over me. It's affecting my sleep and my ability to focus at work.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

**Patient:** Yeah, my appetite's been all over the place. Some days I don't feel like eating at all, and other days I just snack on whatever's around. I've lost about 5 pounds over the last couple of months.

**Doctor:** It sounds like the pain and mood issues are having a big impact on your quality of life. Let's perform a physical examination to better understand what's going on with your back. Could you please stand up and try to touch your toes?

**Patient:** Sure, but it hurts when I bend forward.

**Doctor:** Take it slow. (Patient attempts to bend) I see. Can you let me know when the pain intensifies?

**Patient:** It starts getting worse about halfway down.

**Doctor:** Okay, let’s check your range of motion. Could you turn to your side and lean backward for me? (Patient performs movement) Do you feel any pain doing that?

**Patient:** Yeah, but it’s not as bad as bending forward. It’s more of a pressure than a sharp pain.

**Doctor:** Thank you. Let's also check the reflexes and sensation in your legs to ensure there's no nerve involvement. (Doctor performs neurological examination) Everything seems normal here, which is good.

**Patient:** That’s a relief.

**Doctor:** Now, considering your symptoms and the impact on your mental health, it’s important to address both these aspects in your management plan. How do you feel about your current pain management regimen?

**Patient:** Well, I'm on some painkillers, but they only take the edge off. I’m worried about taking them long-term.

**Doctor:** It's understandable to be cautious. We need to optimize your pain management while considering your mental health needs. I think incorporating a multidisciplinary approach would be beneficial. Physical therapy could help improve your back issues, and cognitive-behavioral therapy might assist with the mental health aspects. What are your thoughts on this?

**Patient:** That sounds like a good plan. I’ve been hesitant about seeing a therapist, but I think it’s time I try it.

**Doctor:** Great. I can refer you to a psychologist specializing in chronic pain and mental health. Additionally, I’ll prescribe a medication that can help with both pain and mood, such as duloxetine. It’s an SNRI that can address both neuropathic pain and depression.

**Patient:** I’ve heard of that. Will it have any side effects?

**Doctor:** Like all medications, it can have side effects, but many people tolerate it well. Common ones include nausea and dizziness initially, but these usually settle. I’ll start you on a low dose and we can adjust as needed.

**Patient:** Okay, I’m willing to try it.

**Doctor:** Let’s also revisit your pain management strategy. I’ll recommend a consultation with a pain specialist to explore other options, such as injections or TENS therapy, which could help alleviate your back pain without relying heavily on oral medications.

**Patient:** That would be helpful.

**Doctor:** Lastly, I’d like you to have some imaging done to rule out any structural causes for your back pain, like an MRI. We’ll need to get a clearer picture of what’s happening.

**Patient:** Sure, whatever you think is best.

**Doctor:** I’ll organize these referrals and the imaging request for you. Let’s schedule a follow-up in two weeks to review your progress and make any necessary adjustments. Does that sound good?

**Patient:** Yes, thank you. I appreciate all your help.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mr. Thompson. I’ll also prepare a Mental Health Treatment Plan, which will allow you to access Medicare rebates for psychological services, using MBS item 2715. For today’s consultation, given the complexity and duration, I’ll be billing MBS item 36.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

**Doctor:** That’s great to hear. We’ll work through this together. Take care and I’ll see you soon.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
