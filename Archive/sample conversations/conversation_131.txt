CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Alex. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. I've been having a rough time. My asthma's been acting up more than usual, and I've been feeling pretty down. I think my anxiety is getting worse.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a closer look at everything. How often are you experiencing asthma symptoms now, and what's triggering them?

**Patient:** It seems to be worse at night, maybe three or four times a week. Exercise is also a big trigger, and I've noticed that stress makes it worse as well.

**Doctor:** That sounds quite disruptive. Are you using your inhaler more frequently?

**Patient:** Yes, I'm using my reliever inhaler almost every day now.

**Doctor:** It sounds like we need to adjust your asthma management plan. Tell me more about your anxiety. How often do you feel anxious, and how is it affecting your daily life?

**Patient:** It's almost constant, Doctor. I feel on edge all the time, and it's hard to concentrate at work. I also have trouble sleeping because my mind just keeps racing.

**Doctor:** That must be very challenging. Have you noticed any specific situations or thoughts that trigger your anxiety?

**Patient:** Work deadlines really get to me, and I've been worrying a lot about my health, especially with my asthma getting worse.

**Doctor:** It's understandable to feel that way, especially with multiple health concerns. Let's also review your current medications. Are you taking anything for anxiety or your asthma besides the inhaler?

**Patient:** Just my inhaler for asthma. For anxiety, I haven't been on any medication.

**Doctor:** Okay, let's do a quick physical examination to check your respiratory status and overall health. Please take a deep breath for me... Any discomfort there?

**Patient:** A little tightness.

**Doctor:** Your lung sounds indicate some wheezing, which aligns with the increased asthma symptoms you've described. I also want to check your blood pressure and heart rate... They're within normal ranges, which is good. Now, let’s discuss a management plan focusing on both your asthma and anxiety.

**Patient:** That would be great. I really need some relief.

**Doctor:** For your asthma, we need to consider stepping up your medication. I recommend starting you on a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and hopefully decrease your dependency on the reliever inhaler. We'll review your asthma management plan, including avoidance of triggers.

**Patient:** That sounds good. What about my anxiety?

**Doctor:** For your anxiety, we have a few options. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is highly effective and can help you manage stress more constructively. Would you be open to seeing a psychologist?

**Patient:** Yes, I'd be willing to try that.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I can refer you to a psychologist under a Mental Health Treatment Plan, which will allow for Medicare rebates for up to 10 sessions per calendar year. I'll also prescribe a short course of an anti-anxiety medication to help stabilize your symptoms while you start therapy. We’ll carefully monitor this.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. That plan sounds reassuring.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Alex. Let's discuss how these conditions might interact. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate asthma symptoms, so managing your mental health is crucial for improving your respiratory health. Regular follow-ups will be essential.

**Patient:** I understand. I’ll make sure to attend all sessions.

**Doctor:** Great to hear. Now, regarding billing: today’s consultation involves chronic disease management, mental health planning, and a significant degree of complexity due to multiple co-morbidities. We’ll use MBS item 36 for a long consultation during normal hours, item 721 for the chronic disease management plan, and item 2715 for the mental health care plan.

**Patient:** Makes sense. I appreciate you explaining that.

**Doctor:** No problem. We'll schedule a follow-up in two weeks to reassess your asthma control and mental health progress. Please contact us if you need any adjustments before then.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel more hopeful with a concrete plan.

**Doctor:** You're doing the right thing, Alex. We’re here to help you every step of the way. Take care, and see you soon.

**Patient:** Thanks again, Doctor. See you soon.
