CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Sarah. How have you been since our last visit?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been okay, but I'm still struggling with a few things.

**Doctor:** I see. Let's make sure we address everything today. I know we've been working on your mental health care and assessing your allergies. Why don't we start with how you've been feeling mentally?

**Patient:** Well, I've been feeling quite anxious lately, especially when I'm out in crowded places. It's a bit overwhelming. I've also been having trouble sleeping. I'll lie in bed for hours before I manage to fall asleep.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds quite distressing. Have there been any specific triggers or events that have heightened your anxiety recently?

**Patient:** I can't pinpoint anything specific. It just seems to happen, and then I start worrying about everything. It's like my mind doesn't have an off switch sometimes.

**Doctor:** That must be challenging. Have you noticed any physical symptoms accompanying the anxiety, such as a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, or muscle tension?

**Patient:** Yes, my heart races a lot, and I sometimes feel like I can't catch my breath. My shoulders and neck are always tense.

**Doctor:** Those are common symptoms of anxiety. It's important to address these issues as they can significantly impact your quality of life. Have you continued with the cognitive behavioral therapy we discussed last time?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been attending sessions once a week. It helps, but I think I need something more.

**Doctor:** We can consider that. Let's also talk about your sleep. You mentioned having trouble falling asleep. How many hours of sleep are you getting on average?

**Patient:** Probably around four or five hours, and it's not restful. I wake up feeling exhausted.

**Doctor:** That's definitely not enough. Poor sleep can exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Do you have a sleep routine or any practices that help you wind down at night?

**Patient:** I usually watch TV or scroll through my phone until I'm really tired. Then I try to sleep.

**Doctor:** It might help to establish a more consistent bedtime routine. Try to limit screen time an hour before bed and perhaps consider activities like reading or meditation to help you relax.

**Patient:** I'll give that a try. It makes sense.

**Doctor:** Great. Now, regarding your allergies, you mentioned last time that you were having frequent sneezing and itchy eyes, right?

**Patient:** Yes, it's been quite bothersome, especially in the mornings and when I'm outside.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any particular triggers, like pollen, dust, or certain foods?

**Patient:** Pollen, definitely. I also think dust at home might be an issue. I haven't noticed any food triggers, though.

**Doctor:** It sounds like you might have allergic rhinitis, possibly seasonal. Have you used any medications to alleviate the symptoms?

**Patient:** I've tried over-the-counter antihistamines, but they only help a little.

**Doctor:** There are other options we can consider. I think it would be beneficial to perform a skin prick test to identify specific allergens. Would you be comfortable with that?

**Patient:** Yes, if it helps identify what's causing this, I'm all for it.

**Doctor:** Excellent. We'll set that up. In the meantime, I recommend starting a nasal corticosteroid spray. It's more effective for nasal symptoms than antihistamines alone. Would you like me to explain how to use it?

**Patient:** Yes, please.

**Doctor:** You'll need to spray it into each nostril once daily. It's important to use it regularly, even if you're feeling okay, to keep the symptoms at bay. I'll provide a prescription for that.

**Patient:** Thank you. That sounds manageable.

**Doctor:** Let's summarize and create a management plan. For your anxiety, continue with cognitive behavioral therapy and establish a soothing bedtime routine. For sleep, try limiting screen time and perhaps incorporate relaxation techniques. We can also consider medication if needed.

**Patient:** That sounds good. I'm open to trying new strategies.

**Doctor:** As for your allergies, we'll arrange for a skin prick test and start you on a nasal corticosteroid spray. Please keep track of your symptoms and any new triggers you might notice.

**Patient:** I will. Thank you for your help, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Sarah. We’ll follow up in a month to see how the new strategies and medications are working for you. If you have any concerns before then, don’t hesitate to reach out.

**Patient:** I appreciate that. I'll see you in a month.

**Doctor:** Take care, and we'll talk soon.

**Patient:** Thanks, Doctor. Bye.
