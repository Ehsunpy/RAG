CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Morning, Doctor. I've been managing, but there have been a few issues. My asthma seems to be acting up, and I've been feeling quite anxious lately. Plus, my blood sugar levels have been a bit erratic.

**Doctor:** I see. Let’s tackle these issues one by one. Let’s start with your asthma. Have you noticed any specific triggers or changes in your symptoms?

**Patient:** Well, the weather's been all over the place, and I've found myself using the inhaler more often, especially at night. I wake up short of breath sometimes.

**Doctor:** That sounds uncomfortable. Are you experiencing any wheezing, coughing, or tightness in your chest during the day?

**Patient:** Yes, mostly in the mornings and evenings. It’s not constant, but frequent enough to be bothersome.

**Doctor:** How about your peak flow readings? Have you been able to check them regularly?

**Patient:** They're definitely lower than usual. I used to be around 450, but lately, I've been averaging around 380.

**Doctor:** Given these symptoms and your lower peak flow readings, it seems your asthma might not be as controlled as it could be. We might need to adjust your medication. Are you still using the Seretide inhaler, and how often?

**Patient:** Yes, I use it twice a day, but I sometimes skip it if I feel okay.

**Doctor:** Consistency is key with asthma management. Skipping doses can lead to poor control. Let’s ensure we address this. Now, regarding your blood sugar levels—have you been monitoring them, and what have your readings been like?

**Patient:** They've been fluctuating a lot, between 7 and 11 mmol/L. I try to eat healthily, but stress has been making it hard to stick to my routine.

**Doctor:** Stress can certainly affect your blood sugar. Are you still on Metformin and Gliclazide?

**Patient:** Yes, I am.

**Doctor:** Good. We might need to review your dosage or consider additional medication if these fluctuations persist. Now, regarding your anxiety, can you tell me more about what you’re experiencing?

**Patient:** It’s mostly an overwhelming feeling that comes out of nowhere. My heart races, and I get restless. It’s been worse with work stress lately.

**Doctor:** Have you had any panic attacks or trouble sleeping?

**Patient:** I’ve had a couple of panic attacks, yes. Sleep has been difficult, too. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep.

**Doctor:** This sounds quite distressing. I’m glad you brought it up. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or seen anyone for counseling?

**Patient:** I tried some breathing exercises, but I haven’t seen a counselor yet.

**Doctor:** I think a mental health care plan could be beneficial for you. It would allow us to refer you to a psychologist for further support. Let’s also consider a low dose of an anti-anxiety medication to help manage your symptoms.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea. I’ve been hesitant, but I think it’s time to try something.

**Doctor:** It’s a positive step forward. Let’s perform a physical examination now to check your lungs and overall health.

[**Doctor performs a thorough physical examination, including listening to the patient's lungs, checking blood pressure, and examining for any physical signs of stress or chronic disease complications.**]

**Doctor:** Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/90, and I can hear some wheezing in your chest. We definitely need to address your asthma control. I’ll adjust your medication and prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. We’ll also review your diabetes management plan and might add a medication to help stabilize your blood sugar.

**Patient:** Alright, I’m ready to make some changes.

**Doctor:** Great to hear. For billing today, given the complexity of managing these multiple conditions, we’ll use the MBS item 36 for a long consultation. It covers the time and complexity of today’s session. I’ll also prepare a mental health care plan under item 2715, which will allow you access to psychological services.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness.

**Doctor:** It’s my pleasure. Let’s arrange a follow-up in two weeks to see how you’re responding to the changes. In the meantime, keep monitoring your blood sugar and peak flow, and start with the breathing exercises daily. I’ll also give you a referral for the psychologist.

**Patient:** I will. Thank you so much for your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
