**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I'm doing okay, but I've been having a bit of trouble with a spot on my arm.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more about what's been going on?

**Patient:** Sure, about two weeks ago, I noticed a small, red bump on my right forearm. It's gotten a bit bigger and has started to itch and bleed a little if I scratch it.

**Doctor:** I see. Have you noticed any changes in color, or has the bump become painful?

**Patient:** It's still red, but it's more raised now than when I first noticed it. It's not really painful, just itchy and annoying.

**Doctor:** Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or swelling in your lymph nodes?

**Patient:** No, nothing like that. I feel fine otherwise.

**Doctor:** Alright. Have you had any history of skin issues, allergies, or notable sun exposure recently?

**Patient:** I had a similar bump a few years ago, and the doctor removed it, saying it was a benign cyst. I do spend a fair amount of time in the sun because of my work, but I try to use sunscreen.

**Doctor:** That's good to know. Let's have a closer look at it. Please roll up your sleeve.

**Patient:** Sure, here you go.

**Doctor:** [Examining the forearm] The lesion is about 1 cm in diameter, raised and erythematous. There's a bit of crusting on top, likely from scratching. No signs of infection or pus, which is good. Let me also check your lymph nodes. [Palpates the axillary lymph nodes] No swelling here.

**Patient:** Is it anything serious?

**Doctor:** At this point, it's difficult to say without a biopsy, but it seems to be a benign lesion, possibly a seborrheic keratosis or an irritated mole. However, given your history and its changes, I'd recommend excising it to be certain.

**Patient:** Okay. What does the procedure involve?

**Doctor:** It's a minor surgical procedure that we can do here in the clinic. We'll clean the area, numb it with a local anesthetic, and then remove the lesion. I'll send it to the lab for histopathology to ensure it's benign. The whole process should take about 20 minutes.

**Patient:** That sounds reasonable. How soon can we do it?

**Doctor:** We can schedule it for later this week. I'll have my receptionist arrange a convenient time for you. After the procedure, you'll need to keep the area clean and dry, and we'll arrange a follow-up to discuss the results.

**Patient:** Alright, that sounds like a plan. 

**Doctor:** Great. I'll also give you a pamphlet with post-procedure care instructions. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

**Patient:** No, that covers it. Thanks for your help, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. We'll take good care of you. See you later this week.
