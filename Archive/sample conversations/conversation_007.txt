CONVERSATION:

Doctor: Good evening, Mr. Thompson. I understand you’re here for a couple of issues tonight. Could you tell me a bit more about what’s been troubling you?

Patient: Sure, Doctor. I've been having quite a bit of pain in my lower back for the past few weeks, and it's been getting worse. Also, I've been having issues with my ears, especially my right one. It feels blocked, and I think it might need syringing.

Doctor: I see. Let's start with your back pain. Can you describe the nature of the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or burning? And does it radiate anywhere?

Patient: It's mostly a dull ache, but sometimes it gets sharper, especially when I bend over or lift something. It doesn't really radiate, but it does get worse when I sit for long periods.

Doctor: That’s helpful. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate it?

Patient: I’d say it’s around a 6 most days, but it can spike to an 8 when it flares up.

Doctor: Have you noticed any associated symptoms, like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs?

Patient: No, nothing like that. It’s mostly just the pain.

Doctor: And how about any recent injuries or changes in your activity level?

Patient: No recent injuries. I have been sitting more at work, though, and started playing tennis again last month.

Doctor: That gives me a better picture. Let’s move on to your ear. How long have you been experiencing this blockage?

Patient: It started about a week ago. It feels like there's water in there, and my hearing is a bit muffled.

Doctor: Any pain or discharge from the ear?

Patient: No pain, but sometimes it feels itchy.

Doctor: Let me take a look at both your back and your ear. First, I'll examine your back. Could you please stand up and bend forward as much as you can without discomfort?

Patient: [Patient stands and bends forward slightly] That’s about as far as I can go without it hurting too much.

Doctor: Alright, I can see there’s some restriction there. I'll palpate your lower back now. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. [Doctor palpates the lumbar region]

Patient: That’s a bit tender, especially on the right side.

Doctor: Thank you. Now, for your ear. I’ll use the otoscope to check inside. [Doctor examines the ear]

Doctor: It looks like there’s quite a bit of cerumen buildup. No signs of infection, though. We can certainly manage that today with syringing.

Patient: That would be great.

Doctor: For your back, it sounds like muscle strain, possibly from overuse or poor posture. I recommend starting with some physiotherapy to strengthen your back muscles and improve posture. Also, using a heat pack at home can help relieve the pain. For now, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication should help manage the pain.

Patient: Okay, that sounds manageable.

Doctor: As for your ear, we’ll perform the syringing today. It should provide immediate relief from the blockage. I’ll prepare the equipment and explain the procedure to you. We’ll use warm water to gently flush out the wax. You might feel a bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful.

Patient: That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor.

Doctor: You’re welcome. We should also book a follow-up appointment to reassess your back and ensure the ear blockage doesn’t recur. I’ll have the nurse assist with scheduling that. If you experience any worsening of symptoms or new symptoms, please contact us immediately.

Patient: Will do. Thank you for your help.

Doctor: It’s my pleasure. Let’s get started with your ear syringing now.
