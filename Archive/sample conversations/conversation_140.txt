CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How have you been feeling since your last visit?

**Patient:** Morning, Doctor. I've been better. My blood pressure seems to be all over the place lately, and I've been feeling quite down.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's start by talking about your blood pressure. Have you been monitoring it at home?

**Patient:** Yes, I have. It's been fluctuating a lot, sometimes it's as high as 150/95, and other times it's closer to 120/80.

**Doctor:** I see. Have there been any changes in your lifestyle, diet, or stress levels that might be contributing to this variability?

**Patient:** Well, work has been quite stressful lately, and I haven't been exercising as much. My diet's been a bit off too, with more takeaways than I'd like to admit.

**Doctor:** Stress can certainly impact your blood pressure. It's also important to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?

**Patient:** Occasionally, I get dizzy when I stand up too quickly, and I've had a few headaches, but nothing too severe.

**Doctor:** Okay, let's review your current medications. You're on lisinopril for hypertension, correct?

**Patient:** Yes, 20 mg once a day.

**Doctor:** And are you taking it consistently?

**Patient:** Mostly. I did miss a couple of doses last week.

**Doctor:** It's crucial to take it regularly. Missing doses can contribute to those fluctuations. Now, regarding your mood, you mentioned feeling down. Can you tell me more about that?

**Patient:** I've just been feeling more tired and less interested in things I usually enjoy. It's been hard to concentrate at work, and my sleep's not great either.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. Have you had any previous episodes like this?

**Patient:** A few years ago, I had a similar period, but it passed on its own.

**Doctor:** Mental health is just as important as physical health. Depression can also affect your motivation to exercise and manage your diet, which in turn impacts your blood pressure. Have you thought about speaking with a counselor or therapist?

**Patient:** I have, but I just haven't had the time.

**Doctor:** I understand. Finding time can be challenging, but it might be beneficial. I can refer you to someone who works flexible hours. Let’s also consider starting you on an antidepressant, which can help stabilize your mood.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea. I'm open to trying medication.

**Doctor:** Great. We can start with sertraline, which is generally well-tolerated. We'll start with a low dose and adjust as necessary. Now, let's perform a physical examination to ensure there are no other issues contributing to your symptoms.

**Patient:** Alright.

**Doctor:** [The doctor performs a comprehensive physical examination, checking blood pressure in both arms, listening to heart and lungs, and assessing reflexes and vision.] Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today at 145/92, but your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Lungs are clear, and reflexes are intact. Based on your symptoms and examination, I believe your hypertension and mood symptoms might be related.

**Patient:** That makes sense.

**Doctor:** For your blood pressure, I suggest re-emphasizing lifestyle modifications alongside your medication. We’ll increase your lisinopril dosage slightly to see if that stabilizes the readings. For mental health, starting sertraline can help, and I’ll make that referral to a mental health professional.

**Patient:** Okay, I think I can manage that.

**Doctor:** Excellent. Let's also schedule a follow-up in four weeks to reassess your blood pressure and mood. I’ll order some blood tests today to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and electrolytes, just to cover all bases.

**Patient:** Sounds good. Thank you for your help, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You're welcome. Before we finish, I'll prepare the necessary paperwork for your medication and the mental health care plan. Considering the complexity of managing these concurrent conditions, we'll bill this under the MBS item 36 for a long consultation due to the time and the detailed management required.

**Patient:** Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time.

**Doctor:** My pleasure. Take care, Mr. Johnson, and we'll see you in a month. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes before then.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks again.
