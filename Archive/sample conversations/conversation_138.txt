CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been better, to be honest. My back pain has been quite persistent, and it’s really getting to me mentally.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take our time to go through everything. I understand it's not just physical but also emotionally taxing. Can you describe the back pain for me? How long has it been a problem?

**Patient:** I've had this dull, throbbing pain in my lower back for about 5 years now. It gets worse with prolonged sitting or standing, and it's been more intense these past few months.

**Doctor:** I see. And you mentioned it's affecting your mental health. Can you tell me more about that?

**Patient:** Yes, it’s quite frustrating. I feel like it's holding me back from doing things I enjoy, and sometimes I just feel really down because of it.

**Doctor:** That’s understandable. Chronic pain can indeed take a toll on mental health. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep patterns?

**Patient:** My mood has been quite low, and I find it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night. I wake up feeling tired.

**Doctor:** Alright. It sounds like the pain might be contributing to some depressive symptoms. We’ll address both the physical and mental aspects. Do you have any history of depression or anxiety?

**Patient:** I was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago, but it was mild. I took some medication for a while, but I haven’t been on it for over a year now.

**Doctor:** Thank you for sharing that. Let's talk about your musculoskeletal issues. Have you had any imaging done recently, like an MRI or X-rays?

**Patient:** I had an MRI about a year ago. It showed some degeneration in the discs, but nothing was done about it since then.

**Doctor:** Degenerative disc disease can certainly cause the symptoms you’re describing. I’d like to do a physical examination to assess your range of motion and pinpoint any specific areas of tenderness or discomfort. Is that alright?

**Patient:** Sure, that’s fine.

**Doctor:** Please stand up and try bending forward, backward, and side to side. Let me know if you feel any pain or restriction.

**Patient:** Bending forward is okay, but bending backward causes pain in my lower back. Side bending is a bit stiff but not painful.

**Doctor:** Thank you. Now, let me check for any muscle spasms or tenderness. [Doctor palpates the lumbar region.] Does it hurt when I press here?

**Patient:** Yes, that's quite tender.

**Doctor:** I can feel some muscle tightness there. Let's also check your reflexes and strength. [Doctor performs neurological examination.] Everything seems normal there, which is good.

**Patient:** That’s a relief, at least.

**Doctor:** Now, given your symptoms and history, I believe the chronic pain is likely contributing to your mood issues. It's important that we address both. For the pain, have you tried any physical therapy or exercises?

**Patient:** I did physical therapy for a while, but I stopped because I didn't see much improvement.

**Doctor:** Sometimes, it takes a while to see benefits, especially with chronic conditions. I’d recommend starting that again. We can also explore different pain management strategies, like medication or even cognitive behavioral therapy, which can help with both pain perception and mood.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea. I’m willing to try anything at this point.

**Doctor:** For medications, we might consider a low-dose antidepressant that can help with both mood and pain. Have you had any side effects from medications in the past?

**Patient:** The last antidepressant I tried made me feel a bit drowsy, but that was it.

**Doctor:** We can start on a different one with fewer sedative effects. I’ll prescribe Duloxetine, which is often used for both depression and chronic pain. We’ll start at a low dose and adjust as needed.

**Patient:** Okay, I’m open to trying that.

**Doctor:** Let’s also set up a mental health care plan. This will allow us to schedule sessions with a psychologist who specializes in chronic pain.

**Patient:** That makes sense.

**Doctor:** Regarding the billing, for today's consultation, we'll be using an MBS item number that reflects a prolonged consultation and the complexity of managing multiple conditions. I’ll document our discussion and the management plan in detail.

**Patient:** Sounds good. Thank you, Doctor.

**Doctor:** To summarize, we’re going to restart physical therapy, begin Duloxetine, and arrange a mental health care plan. I’ll also refer you to a psychologist. Let’s follow up in a month to see how you’re doing and adjust the plan as necessary.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome. Please book your follow-up appointment with the receptionist, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. Take care, Mr. Johnson.
