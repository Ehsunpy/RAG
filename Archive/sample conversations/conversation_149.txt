CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How have you been feeling since our last visit?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been having a really tough time managing everything. My back pain hasn't gotten any better, and it's starting to affect my mood, too.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's take a thorough look at everything you're dealing with today. Can you describe the pain you're experiencing? Is it localized, or does it radiate?

**Patient:** It's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes I feel it shooting down my leg. It's like a dull, constant ache, but when I move a certain way, it becomes really sharp.

**Doctor:** That sounds quite uncomfortable. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate it?

**Patient:** I’d say it’s about a 6 most of the time, but it can spike to an 8 when it’s bad.

**Doctor:** I see. And how is this affecting your daily activities?

**Patient:** It’s been hard to do basic things, like getting out of bed or sitting for a long time. I used to go for walks, but now I’m hesitant because I’m afraid of making it worse.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any changes in your mood or mental health lately?

**Patient:** Yes, definitely. I feel more anxious and, at times, quite low. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m not able to do the things I enjoy.

**Doctor:** It sounds like your chronic pain might be impacting your mental health. Have you had any changes in your sleep pattern, appetite, or energy levels?

**Patient:** My sleep has been pretty poor. I wake up a lot during the night, and I’m tired during the day. My appetite is okay, but I just feel exhausted.

**Doctor:** It’s not uncommon for chronic pain to affect sleep and mood. Let’s explore what we can do to manage these interconnected concerns. I’d like to do a physical examination to better understand your musculoskeletal issues. Could you please stand for me and try bending forward and to the sides?

**Patient:** *[Patient performs the movements, wincing slightly.]*

**Doctor:** I can see there's some discomfort there. I’ll also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please try to resist against my hand. *[Doctor proceeds with the examination.]*

**Patient:** Okay. *[Patient complies with the examination.]*

**Doctor:** Your reflexes and strength seem intact, which is good. However, the pain and its radiation down the leg suggest there may be nerve involvement, possibly from a condition like sciatica or a herniated disc. We may need imaging studies to confirm this.

**Patient:** I see. What about my anxiety and low mood? Could they be related to the pain?

**Doctor:** Yes, pain and mood disorders often reinforce each other. Chronic pain can lead to feelings of helplessness or anxiety, which in turn can make pain feel worse. Addressing both issues together often yields the best outcomes.

**Patient:** That makes sense. What can we do about it?

**Doctor:** For your back, I’d recommend starting with some physiotherapy to improve your mobility and pain management exercises. We can also consider a referral to a pain specialist if necessary. For the mental health aspect, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been very effective in helping people manage chronic pain and improve mood. Would you be open to seeing a psychologist?

**Patient:** Yes, I think that could help.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll coordinate a Mental Health Care Plan for you, which will allow you to access Medicare rebates for psychological services. For the pain, I’ll prescribe a medication that can help with both nerve pain and anxiety. It’s called duloxetine. Have you heard of it before?

**Patient:** I haven’t, but I’m willing to try anything at this point.

**Doctor:** Duloxetine can help with both the physical and emotional aspects of your condition. It’s important to monitor for side effects, such as nausea or dizziness, especially at the start. We’ll schedule a follow-up visit to see how you’re doing and adjust the plan as needed.

**Patient:** Okay, thank you. What about the imaging you mentioned earlier?

**Doctor:** Yes, I’ll refer you for an MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s happening with your spine. That will help us tailor your treatment more specifically.

**Patient:** Sounds good. I really appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** It’s my pleasure. To summarize, we’ll initiate physiotherapy, start on duloxetine, arrange a Mental Health Care Plan for psychological support, and proceed with an MRI. I’ll also provide you with resources on pain management techniques that you can practice at home.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel more hopeful about managing this now.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mrs. Thompson. Remember, managing chronic conditions is a journey, and we’ll take it step by step. I’ll see you in two weeks for a review. If you have any concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

**Patient:** I will. Thank you again.

**Doctor:** Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
