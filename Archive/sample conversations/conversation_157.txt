CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good evening, Mr. Thompson. How are you today?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. I've been better, to be honest. Been feeling quite overwhelmed lately.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s go through everything. We have some time, so we’ll take it step by step. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?

**Patient:** Sure. I've been having a tough time managing my diabetes. My blood sugar levels have been all over the place, and it's stressing me out. I also feel like my anxiety is creeping back in, and I'm worried about how it's affecting everything else.

**Doctor:** I understand. Managing diabetes can be challenging, especially if you’re feeling anxious. Let’s talk about your blood sugar levels first. How have they been fluctuating?

**Patient:** They're mostly high, around 180 to 220 mg/dL in the mornings. Sometimes, it goes down to 140 mg/dL, but it doesn't seem consistent.

**Doctor:** And how often are you checking your levels?

**Patient:** Usually twice a day, in the morning and before dinner.

**Doctor:** Have there been any changes in your routine, diet, or medication recently?

**Patient:** Not really. I try to stick to my usual diet, but with work being more stressful lately, I might have skipped meals or had a few more snacks than usual. Plus, with the anxiety, I sometimes forget to take my medication on time.

**Doctor:** That could definitely contribute to the fluctuations. Let's also discuss your anxiety. You mentioned it’s been creeping back. How is it manifesting?

**Patient:** I’m having trouble sleeping, and my mind races with all sorts of worries, mostly about work and my health. I feel tense and on edge most of the day.

**Doctor:** That sounds difficult. Have you noticed any specific triggers, or is it more generalized?

**Patient:** It’s mostly work-related stress, but I think I’m also worried about my health spiraling out of control, which adds to it.

**Doctor:** It’s understandable that stress and anxiety can exacerbate your diabetes management. They often go hand in hand. Are you currently taking any medication for your anxiety?

**Patient:** I was on an SSRI about two years ago, but I stopped as I felt better. I haven't taken anything since.

**Doctor:** Considering your current symptoms, we might need to revisit that option. But first, let’s do a quick physical exam to check your vitals and see if there’s anything else we should address right away.

**Patient:** Okay.

**Doctor:** [Conducts examination] Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 135/85, which could be stress-related. Heart rate is a bit on the higher side too. Based on your height and weight, your BMI is in the overweight range, which we’ll need to keep an eye on. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like frequent urination or increased thirst?

**Patient:** I do feel thirsty more often, and I guess I’ve been urinating more too, but I thought it was because I was drinking more water.

**Doctor:** It could be related to your blood sugar levels. We’ll need to make sure there’s nothing more concerning going on with your kidneys or other systems. I’d like to order some blood tests, including your HbA1c, and possibly a renal function test.

**Patient:** That makes sense.

**Doctor:** Regarding your mental health, would you be open to seeing a psychologist or counselor again? It could help address the anxiety and stress, which might improve your diabetes management indirectly.

**Patient:** Yes, I think that would be helpful. I’m open to it.

**Doctor:** Great. I'll provide you with a Mental Health Treatment Plan. This allows you to access Medicare rebates for psychological services. We can also consider reintroducing medication if needed, but let’s see how you go with therapy first.

**Patient:** Okay, that sounds like a good plan.

**Doctor:** For your diabetes, let's adjust your current management. I’ll refer you to a diabetes educator who can work with you on a more detailed plan, including dietary adjustments. We’ll also schedule a follow-up in two weeks to review your blood test results and progress.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that.

**Doctor:** No problem. I’ll also give you a Care Plan and Team Care Arrangements. This will help coordinate your care among the different health professionals involved. Now, regarding the billing, since this is an after-hours consultation lasting 31 minutes, we'll be using the appropriate MBS item numbers. The complexity of your situation, with both chronic disease and mental health components, justifies this comprehensive approach.

**Patient:** I understand. Thank you for explaining everything.

**Doctor:** My pleasure. Remember, managing multiple conditions can be complex, but with a structured plan, we can make it more manageable. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before our next appointment.

**Patient:** I will. Thanks again, Doctor.

**Doctor:** Take care, Mr. Thompson. We’ll talk soon.
