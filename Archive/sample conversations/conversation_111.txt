CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been having a few issues, actually. My asthma seems to be flaring up more often, and I've been feeling quite down and anxious. It's been a bit overwhelming.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let's tackle these concerns one by one. We'll start with your asthma. Can you tell me more about your recent flare-ups? How often are they occurring, and what seems to trigger them?

**Patient:** It’s been happening almost every week now. I notice it more when I'm stressed or when the weather changes suddenly. Sometimes even when I'm just doing chores around the house.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. Are you using your inhaler more frequently during these episodes?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been using it a lot more. Sometimes I feel like it’s not as effective as it used to be.

**Doctor:** I see. It’s important we manage your asthma effectively to prevent these frequent flare-ups. We’ll review your asthma action plan today. Now, let’s discuss your mental health. You mentioned feeling down and anxious. Can you describe these feelings a bit more?

**Patient:** I’ve been feeling very low, like I can't get out of bed some days. I’m anxious about everything, and it’s hard to focus on anything. It’s been affecting my sleep, too.

**Doctor:** Have there been any changes in your life recently that might be contributing to this, or has this been a gradual development?

**Patient:** It’s been building up over the past few months. Work has been stressful and managing everything at home is overwhelming.

**Doctor:** It sounds like there’s a lot on your plate. Stress can definitely exacerbate asthma symptoms and impact mental health. Let me take a few moments to check your vital signs and perform a quick respiratory examination. Please take a deep breath and exhale for me. [Doctor listens with a stethoscope.]

**Doctor:** Your lungs sound a bit constricted, which aligns with what you’re experiencing. I’m going to check your peak flow as well. [Doctor checks peak flow.]

**Doctor:** Your peak flow is lower than we’d like it to be, which indicates we need to adjust your asthma management. Before we proceed with a plan, I’d like to discuss how these conditions might be interacting. Stress and anxiety can worsen asthma symptoms, and frequent asthma attacks can increase anxiety, creating a vicious cycle.

**Patient:** That makes sense. It feels like I’m caught in a loop.

**Doctor:** Indeed. Let’s discuss a comprehensive management plan. For your asthma, I’m considering stepping up your inhaler treatment. We might need to add a long-acting bronchodilator or consider a corticosteroid inhaler to better control your symptoms. How do you feel about that?

**Patient:** If it will help, I’m willing to try anything.

**Doctor:** Excellent. For your mental health, I recommend we initiate a Mental Health Care Plan. This will involve some sessions with a psychologist, which can be very beneficial in managing anxiety and depression. How does that sound?

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea. I think talking to someone would help.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll organize a referral for you. Now, let's also address lifestyle factors that might help. Incorporating some regular physical activity, like walking or yoga, could help both your asthma and your mental health. Would you be open to trying that?

**Patient:** Yes, I could try to fit in some walking in the evenings.

**Doctor:** Perfect. Let's also review your diet and sleep habits in a follow-up session to see if we can make some small changes that might help.

**Patient:** Okay, that sounds good.

**Doctor:** Regarding billing, for today’s consultation, given the complexity and time spent, we’ll be using MBS item number 36, which covers a long consultation during normal hours. I’ll also prepare the necessary paperwork for your Mental Health Care Plan, which will involve item number 2715 for the preparation of the plan.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to go through everything.

**Doctor:** It’s my pleasure. I’ll print out your updated asthma action plan and provide you with the referral to a psychologist. Let’s schedule a follow-up in about four weeks to see how you’re doing with the new treatment plan.

**Patient:** Thank you so much. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

**Doctor:** You’re very welcome, Mrs. Thompson. Remember, managing these conditions is a journey, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and I’ll see you in a few weeks.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. See you then.
