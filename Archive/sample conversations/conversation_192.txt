CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good evening, Mr. Thompson. How have you been since your last visit?

**Patient:** Good evening, Doctor. I've been having a tough time managing everything. The pain in my back and knees hasn't let up, and it's been affecting my sleep and mood a lot.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let's try to unpack everything. You mentioned pain in your back and knees. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate it today?

**Patient:** My back pain is around a 7 most days, but today it's an 8. The knee pain fluctuates between a 5 and a 6.

**Doctor:** That sounds quite challenging. Have you noticed any specific activities that worsen or relieve the pain?

**Patient:** Sitting for long periods definitely makes my back worse, and walking or standing for too long affects my knees. Heat pads help a bit, but not much.

**Doctor:** I see. And how’s your sleep been affected by the pain?

**Patient:** I’m waking up multiple times a night because of the discomfort, and it’s hard to fall back asleep.

**Doctor:** Sleep disruption can really exacerbate pain and affect your mental health. Speaking of which, how have you been feeling emotionally?

**Patient:** Honestly, I'm feeling pretty down. I’m frustrated that I can’t do the things I used to enjoy without pain. It’s like a constant weight on me.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels?

**Patient:** I’ve lost a bit of my appetite, and I feel tired most of the time. It’s hard to get motivated to do anything.

**Doctor:** It sounds like your mood is being significantly impacted. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?

**Patient:** No, nothing like that. Just feeling low and overwhelmed.

**Doctor:** Thank you for being honest. It’s important to address these feelings as they can interplay with your chronic pain. Let’s talk a bit about your current treatment regimen. What medications are you currently taking for your pain and mood?

**Patient:** I’m taking ibuprofen for the pain, but not every day because I'm worried about my stomach. For my mood, I was on citalopram, but I stopped a few months ago because I didn’t like the side effects.

**Doctor:** Understood. Ibuprofen can indeed affect your stomach lining, especially with long-term use. We might consider a different approach. As for the citalopram, what kind of side effects were you experiencing?

**Patient:** Mostly nausea and a bit of dizziness. It just felt like it wasn’t worth it.

**Doctor:** Side effects can be tricky. It might be worthwhile to explore other options that could help both your mood and manage your pain. Let’s also do a quick physical examination to assess your mobility and check for any inflammation or tenderness.

**Patient:** Sure.

**Doctor:** (Performing examination) Can you bend forward for me? Any pain when doing that?

**Patient:** Yes, a sharp pain in my lower back.

**Doctor:** And if you bend sideways or rotate your torso, how does that feel?

**Patient:** It’s uncomfortable, but not as sharp.

**Doctor:** Let’s check your knees. Can you bend them for me while standing? Any clicking or pain?

**Patient:** My left knee clicks a bit, and both are painful when bending.

**Doctor:** Thank you. The examination suggests you have some inflammation and possibly some degeneration in your knees, common in chronic conditions. Given your symptoms, I recommend a holistic approach.

**Patient:** What do you suggest?

**Doctor:** For the musculoskeletal pain, we could consider a referral to a physiotherapist. They can work with you on exercises to strengthen your back and knees. We might also explore a referral to a pain specialist. In terms of medication, switching to a different antidepressant could help manage both pain and mood. Duloxetine is one option, as it can address both issues.

**Patient:** That sounds reasonable. I’m open to trying something new.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I’ll also arrange for some blood tests to rule out any inflammatory markers, and we might consider imaging studies if needed. Since this is an after-hours consultation, we’ll use the appropriate MBS item numbers. Given the complexity of managing multiple conditions, I’m considering item numbers 2713 for the mental health care plan and 597 for the after-hours component.

**Patient:** Okay, that makes sense.

**Doctor:** We’ll schedule a follow-up in two weeks to see how you’re responding to the new treatment. Please keep a diary of your pain levels and mood changes in the meantime. It will help us adjust the plan as needed.

**Patient:** I’ll do that. Thanks for your help, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome, Mr. Thompson. We’re here to get you feeling better. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes before our next visit.

**Patient:** I will. Have a good night.

**Doctor:** You too, take care.
