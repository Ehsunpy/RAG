CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How have you been feeling since your last visit?

**Patient:** Morning, Doc. I've been managing, I guess. Some days are better than others. The arthritis seems to be acting up more, and I’ve been feeling quite down lately.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s take a closer look at everything. Could you tell me more about how the arthritis has been affecting you?

**Patient:** Sure. My knees and hands are the worst. Some days, the pain is just so sharp, and it’s hard to move around, especially in the mornings.

**Doctor:** How would you rate the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?

**Patient:** It’s usually around a 6 or 7, but sometimes it spikes to an 8.

**Doctor:** That sounds quite debilitating. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in the joints?

**Patient:** Yes, there’s definitely swelling, especially in my knees. They look puffy by the end of the day.

**Doctor:** Okay. Now, about feeling down, can you describe that a bit more? Are there particular thoughts or symptoms you’ve noticed?

**Patient:** I just feel really low energy and unmotivated. I’m not enjoying things I used to, like gardening. I’ve also been having trouble sleeping, which I guess isn’t helping.

**Doctor:** That sounds tough. How’s your appetite? Any changes there?

**Patient:** Yeah, I’m not eating as much as I used to. Nothing seems appealing.

**Doctor:** I see. It’s important we address this because your mental health can significantly impact your physical health, especially with chronic conditions like arthritis. Have you experienced any similar feelings in the past?

**Patient:** Not like this, no. It’s been worse since I retired last year. I guess I feel a bit lost without work.

**Doctor:** Adjusting to retirement can be challenging and might be contributing to how you’re feeling. Let’s talk about your diabetes management as well. How have your blood sugar levels been?

**Patient:** They’re up and down. I try to follow the diet, but it’s hard to be strict all the time.

**Doctor:** Understandable. Do you have your blood sugar diary with you?

**Patient:** Yes, here it is.

**Doctor:** [reviews the diary] I see some fluctuations here. It looks like there are some high readings, especially after meals. We might need to adjust your medication or diet plan.

**Patient:** Okay.

**Doctor:** Regarding your arthritis, are you taking any medication for it currently?

**Patient:** Just over-the-counter painkillers, but they don’t seem to help much anymore.

**Doctor:** We might need to consider a different class of medication to better control the inflammation. I’ll also examine your knees and hands now, if that’s alright.

**Patient:** Sure.

**Doctor:** [conducts examination] There’s definitely swelling in your knees and some warmth, which indicates inflammation. Your hands also show some stiffness. I’d like to get some blood tests done to check for inflammation markers and possibly adjust your treatment.

**Patient:** Okay, whatever you think is best.

**Doctor:** Let’s also talk about your mental health. I’d recommend a mental health care plan. We can explore options like counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be very effective. How does that sound?

**Patient:** I’d be willing to try. I think talking to someone might help.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll set up a care plan for that. Regarding your diabetes, improving your blood sugar control can also have a positive effect on your mood. We’ll review your diet plan and possibly refer you to a dietitian.

**Patient:** That sounds good.

**Doctor:** Now, let’s go over your management plan. For arthritis, I’ll prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication and arrange for physiotherapy sessions, which can help with mobility and pain. For your mental health, I’ll initiate a mental health care plan, and we’ll schedule regular follow-ups. As for your diabetes, I’ll adjust your medication slightly and refer you to a dietitian for a tailored plan. We’ll also need regular monitoring of your blood pressure and cholesterol given your age and health conditions.

**Patient:** Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it.

**Doctor:** No problem. Before we finish, do you have any questions or concerns?

**Patient:** Just one. How do I go about setting up the counseling sessions?

**Doctor:** I’ll provide you with the referral today, and you can contact the recommended psychologist to schedule an appointment. The mental health care plan covers part of the cost through Medicare.

**Patient:** Alright, thanks.

**Doctor:** I’ll also document today’s consultation and consider MBS billing under item numbers like 36 for a long consultation given the complexity, and 721 for the care plan. Does that sound clear?

**Patient:** Yes, thank you.

**Doctor:** Excellent. Let’s set up a follow-up appointment in about four weeks to see how you’re progressing. Take care, Mr. Thompson.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. See you soon.

**Doctor:** See you soon.
