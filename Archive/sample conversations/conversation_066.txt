CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Ms. Johnson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I'm doing okay, thank you. I'm here for a few reasons, including workcover and some pre-employment assessments.

**Doctor:** I see. Let's tackle these one at a time. I understand you're dealing with a work-related issue. Could you tell me more about that?

**Patient:** Yes, I've been experiencing some lower back pain for a few months now. It started after I lifted a heavy box at work. I filed a workcover claim for it.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Back pain can be quite debilitating. On a scale from 1 to 10, how severe is the pain?

**Patient:** It varies, but on average, I would say it's around a 6. Some days are better than others.

**Doctor:** And do you notice any particular activities that worsen the pain?

**Patient:** Yes, sitting for too long or lifting anything heavy tends to make it worse.

**Doctor:** Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs?

**Patient:** Occasionally, I feel a bit of tingling in my left leg, but no weakness.

**Doctor:** That's important to note. Have you tried any treatments or interventions for the pain so far?

**Patient:** I've been taking over-the-counter pain relief, and my physiotherapist recommended some exercises, which I've been doing regularly.

**Doctor:** That's a good start. I'll conduct a physical examination to check your range of motion and look for any signs of nerve involvement. Please stand up and try bending forward and then backward for me.

**Patient:** [Patient performs the movements.]

**Doctor:** Do you feel any pain when you do that?

**Patient:** Yes, especially when I bend backward.

**Doctor:** All right. Now, let's check your reflexes and strength in your legs. [Doctor performs the examination.] Everything seems normal in terms of reflexes, but the pain with movement suggests a mechanical component, likely musculoskeletal. We'll manage this conservatively, but I'll refer you for an MRI to rule out any significant disc pathology, given the tingling in your leg.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good plan.

**Doctor:** Now, regarding your pre-employment and insurance medicals, what specific assessments are you required to complete?

**Patient:** The new job requires a general health check to ensure I'm fit for work, and the insurance company wants a full medical report.

**Doctor:** Understood. We'll need to conduct a comprehensive examination, including checking your cardiovascular health, respiratory function, and overall physical condition. Let's start with your blood pressure. [Doctor measures blood pressure.] It's within the normal range, which is great. Do you have any history of chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or asthma?

**Patient:** No, I've always been relatively healthy.

**Doctor:** That's good to hear. I'll listen to your heart and lungs next. Please take deep breaths while I listen to your chest. [Doctor conducts the examination.]

**Patient:** [Breathes deeply as instructed.]

**Doctor:** Everything sounds normal. Next, I'll check your abdominal area for any tenderness or abnormalities. [Doctor palpates the abdomen.]

**Patient:** I haven't had any stomach issues, thankfully.

**Doctor:** That's reassuring. Finally, I'll assess your musculoskeletal system. Aside from your back pain, have you experienced any other joint pain or stiffness?

**Patient:** Occasionally, my knees feel a bit stiff, especially in the morning, but it usually goes away after I start moving.

**Doctor:** That's fairly common. We'll keep an eye on that. Based on today's examination, you're in good general health, aside from the back issue. I'll complete the necessary documentation for your pre-employment and insurance requirements.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor.

**Doctor:** For your back pain, I'll prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help with the inflammation and pain. Continue with physiotherapy, and avoid heavy lifting for now. I'll also refer you to a specialist for the MRI. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your MRI results and adjust your treatment plan as needed.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate your thorough approach.

**Doctor:** It's my pleasure. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you soon.
