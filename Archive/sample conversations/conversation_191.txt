CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good evening, Alex. I understand you're here after hours, and I'm glad you came in. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Hi, Doctor. I've been feeling really tired all the time, and it's hard to concentrate at school. I also feel anxious a lot, especially when there are exams or big assignments.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that, Alex. Let's take a closer look at everything to see how we can help. Firstly, you're managing a chronic condition, is that right? Can you tell me a bit more about that?

**Patient:** Yeah, I have type 1 diabetes. I've had it since I was 10. I try to keep my blood sugar levels stable, but it's been hard lately with all the stress from school.

**Doctor:** That makes sense. Managing diabetes can be challenging, especially with the added pressure of school. How often do you monitor your blood glucose levels?

**Patient:** I check it about four to five times a day. Sometimes more if I'm feeling off.

**Doctor:** That's a good frequency. Have you noticed any patterns with your glucose levels when you're feeling more stressed or anxious?

**Patient:** Yeah, when I'm really anxious, my blood sugar goes up. It usually happens before tests or when I have a lot of homework.

**Doctor:** Stress can indeed impact blood glucose levels. Have you had any episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia recently?

**Patient:** I've had a few low blood sugar episodes in the past month, mostly at night. I wake up feeling shaky and sweaty.

**Doctor:** It's important to address those. We'll talk about adjusting your insulin regimen to help with that. Now, regarding your anxiety, how long have you been experiencing this?

**Patient:** It's been getting worse over the past year. I used to get nervous, but now it feels overwhelming sometimes.

**Doctor:** I'm glad you’re bringing this up. Anxiety can have a significant impact on your overall health. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your anxiety on average?

**Patient:** Probably around a 7 most days. It feels like it's just there all the time.

**Doctor:** That sounds difficult. Have you noticed any specific triggers, aside from schoolwork, that make your anxiety worse?

**Patient:** Sometimes, social situations make me anxious too, like when I'm around people I don't know well.

**Doctor:** That's understandable. You're not alone in feeling this way, and there are strategies we can work on together to help manage these feelings. Have you talked to anyone else about how you're feeling, like a counselor or therapist?

**Patient:** No, not really. I've been too nervous to bring it up.

**Doctor:** Reaching out for help can be daunting, but it's a strong and positive step towards feeling better. We can discuss a referral to a mental health professional who specializes in working with teenagers. Would you be open to that?

**Patient:** I guess so. If it can help, I’m willing to try.

**Doctor:** Great. I'll make sure to provide you with the right resources. Let's also talk about your physical health. When was the last time you had a thorough check-up?

**Patient:** I saw my endocrinologist about three months ago.

**Doctor:** Good. Since you're here, I'd like to do a quick physical examination to check your overall health. Is that okay with you?

**Patient:** Sure, that's fine.

**Doctor:** [During the physical examination] Your blood pressure is within normal range, which is great. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs now... Everything sounds normal there too. How has your weight been? Any significant changes?

**Patient:** I think I've lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser.

**Doctor:** I'll note that down. Unintended weight changes can be significant, so we'll monitor it closely. Now, regarding your insulin regimen, are you on a basal-bolus plan?

**Patient:** Yes, I take a long-acting insulin once a day and fast-acting insulin with meals.

**Doctor:** Let's review your doses to see if any adjustments are needed, especially with the recent nighttime lows. We might need to adjust your basal insulin. Do you feel comfortable with that?

**Patient:** Yeah, adjusting it sounds good if it stops the lows.

**Doctor:** We'll start with a slight reduction and monitor your levels closely. I'll give you a detailed plan to follow. Now, regarding the mental health aspect, there are a few options. Therapy is one approach, and we might also consider medication if necessary. How do you feel about trying therapy first?

**Patient:** I think I’d like to try therapy before any medication.

**Doctor:** That sounds like a good plan. I'll provide you with a referral to a therapist who can work with you on strategies to manage anxiety and stress. We can reevaluate in a few weeks to see how you're doing.

**Patient:** Okay, that sounds like a good idea.

**Doctor:** Excellent. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other concerns you have?

**Patient:** No, I think that covers everything.

**Doctor:** Alright, Alex. We've put together a comprehensive management plan. We'll adjust your insulin regimen slightly and start therapy for your anxiety. I'll provide you with all the details and set up a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're progressing. Remember, you can always reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Alex. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
