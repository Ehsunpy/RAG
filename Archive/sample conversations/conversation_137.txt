CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you doing today?

**Patient:** Morning, doctor. I’m doing okay, I guess. Just been feeling overwhelmed lately.

**Doctor:** I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s take some time to go over everything you’re experiencing. I see from your file that you’ve been dealing with some chronic pain and mental health issues. Could you tell me more about how you’re currently feeling?

**Patient:** Sure. The pain in my lower back and shoulders has been pretty persistent, and on top of that, I’ve been feeling anxious more often. I think the pain is making my anxiety worse, and then the anxiety makes the pain feel worse. It’s a vicious cycle.

**Doctor:** That sounds challenging. Chronic pain and anxiety can indeed exacerbate each other. Let’s break it down. Could you describe the back and shoulder pain for me? How would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable?

**Patient:** On most days, I’d say it’s around a 6 or 7. It gets worse if I sit for too long or do any heavy lifting.

**Doctor:** And how long has this been going on?

**Patient:** It’s been going on for about two years now, but it’s been more intense over the last six months.

**Doctor:** Understood. Have you noticed any particular activities or positions that alleviate the pain, even temporarily?

**Patient:** Lying flat on my back sometimes helps, and occasionally, a warm compress eases the tension.

**Doctor:** That’s useful to know. Now, regarding your mental health, how long have you been experiencing increased anxiety?

**Patient:** The anxiety started about a year ago. At first, it was manageable, but it’s been getting progressively worse. I worry about the pain and how it affects my work and daily life.

**Doctor:** I see. It’s important for us to address both the physical and mental aspects. Have you had any trouble sleeping or changes in your appetite?

**Patient:** Yes, my sleep is pretty disturbed. I wake up multiple times a night, and I’ve lost a bit of weight because I don’t have much of an appetite.

**Doctor:** Sleep disturbances and appetite changes can definitely be related to both pain and anxiety. Let’s do a quick physical exam to assess your musculoskeletal issues further. Could you please stand up and try to touch your toes? Let me know if you feel any discomfort.

**Patient:** (Stands and attempts to touch toes) Ouch, that really pulls on my lower back.

**Doctor:** Thank you for doing that. I can see your range of motion is quite limited. Let’s check your shoulders now. Could you raise your arms above your head?

**Patient:** (Raises arms) It feels tight, but not as painful as my back.

**Doctor:** Alright. Based on your exam and symptoms, it seems like you’re dealing with chronic musculoskeletal pain potentially exacerbated by stress and anxiety. I suspect the tension in your muscles might be contributing to the pain, which in turn feeds into your anxiety.

**Patient:** Yeah, that makes sense. What can we do about it?

**Doctor:** First, let’s discuss a management plan that addresses both areas. For the chronic pain, I recommend a combination of physiotherapy to improve your range of motion and muscular strength, and possibly referral for cognitive behavioral therapy to help manage your anxiety. Have you tried physiotherapy before?

**Patient:** I haven’t, but I’m open to it.

**Doctor:** Great. I’ll refer you to a physiotherapist who can work on a tailored exercise program. For your mental health, engaging in CBT can help you develop strategies to manage anxiety and reduce the impact of pain. Do you currently have any support for your mental health?

**Patient:** Not really, I haven’t talked to anyone about it yet.

**Doctor:** That’s okay, we can start that process now. I’ll refer you to a psychologist for CBT. We should also consider a mental health care plan under the MBS, which allows you to access Medicare rebates for up to 10 sessions per calendar year. How does that sound?

**Patient:** That sounds really helpful, thanks.

**Doctor:** In terms of pain management, we should review your current medications. Are you taking anything for the pain?

**Patient:** Just over-the-counter painkillers, but they don’t help much.

**Doctor:** We could explore other options, such as a low-dose antidepressant that can also help with chronic pain and anxiety. I’d like to start you on a medication like amitriptyline, which can be effective for both conditions. We’ll start with a low dose and adjust as needed. Is that something you’d be willing to try?

**Patient:** Yes, I’m willing to give it a shot.

**Doctor:** Excellent. We’ll monitor your response to the medication and adjust if necessary. Now, regarding the billing, today’s consultation involves a complex decision-making process due to the interplay of your chronic conditions and mental health, so I’ll be using MBS item 36 for a long consultation. This covers the detailed assessment and the management plan we’ve discussed.

**Patient:** Okay, thanks for explaining that.

**Doctor:** You’re welcome. I’ll organize the referrals and prescriptions today. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in about four weeks so we can review your progress with the new treatment plan. If you have any issues before then, don’t hesitate to reach out.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks so much for your help, doctor.

**Doctor:** My pleasure. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
