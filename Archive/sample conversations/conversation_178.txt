CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been managing, but there are a few things I'd like to discuss. I've been having some trouble with my blood pressure, and I think my asthma is acting up again.

**Doctor:** I see. Let's start with your blood pressure. Have you been monitoring it regularly at home?

**Patient:** Yes, I have. It's been fluctuating quite a bit. Sometimes it's around 140/90, but it can go as high as 150/95.

**Doctor:** Okay, that's definitely something we need to address. Are you currently on any medication for hypertension?

**Patient:** Yes, I'm taking lisinopril, 20 mg once a day.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any side effects since you started taking it?

**Patient:** Not really, but I sometimes get a dry cough. It hasn't been too bothersome, though.

**Doctor:** That could be related to the lisinopril. It's a known side effect. We might need to adjust your medication if it becomes more of an issue. Now, about your asthma – what symptoms have you been experiencing?

**Patient:** Mostly shortness of breath and wheezing, especially at night. I've also noticed that I get tired more easily when I exercise.

**Doctor:** Are you using your inhaler regularly?

**Patient:** I use my Ventolin inhaler when I need it, but I haven't been consistent with my preventer inhaler, the Symbicort.

**Doctor:** It's really important to use the preventer inhaler regularly. It helps to reduce inflammation and prevent those nighttime symptoms. How often are you using the Symbicort now?

**Patient:** Maybe once or twice a week, but not daily.

**Doctor:** Let's aim to use it twice daily for now and see if that helps with the symptoms. We'll review it in a couple of weeks. Now, you mentioned you also have some antenatal and postnatal care concerns. Could you tell me more about that?

**Patient:** Yes, my partner is pregnant, and I want to ensure I'm supporting her as much as possible. I also want to be prepared for when the baby arrives.

**Doctor:** That's commendable. Have you been attending the antenatal appointments with her?

**Patient:** I've been trying to go to as many as possible. We recently had the 20-week scan, and everything looked good.

**Doctor:** That's great to hear. It's important to stay informed and involved. Are there any specific concerns you have about the pregnancy or postnatal period?

**Patient:** I guess I'm a bit anxious about the postnatal period, especially with sleepless nights and making sure both my partner and the baby are healthy.

**Doctor:** It's normal to feel that way. It might be helpful to attend some antenatal classes, which often cover postnatal care as well. They can provide practical advice on managing the newborn phase.

**Patient:** That sounds helpful. I'll look into it.

**Doctor:** Excellent. Now, let's conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, lungs, and heart. Please take off your shirt, and I'll start with your blood pressure.

**Patient:** Sure, no problem.

**Doctor:** [Conducting examination] Your blood pressure is currently 145/92, which aligns with what you've been recording at home. Let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in and out for me.

**Patient:** [Breathing]

**Doctor:** There's some wheezing in your lungs, which confirms what you mentioned. Let's check your heart sounds. [Listens with stethoscope] Everything sounds normal there.

**Patient:** Okay, that's good to know.

**Doctor:** Based on our discussion and examination, here's the plan: We'll adjust your asthma management by ensuring regular use of the Symbicort twice daily and continue monitoring your blood pressure. I suggest keeping a log of your readings and any symptoms you experience.

**Patient:** I can do that. Should I come back for a follow-up?

**Doctor:** Yes, let's schedule a follow-up in four weeks to reassess both your asthma and blood pressure. In the meantime, if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

**Patient:** Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. Take care, and remember to stay consistent with your medications. See you in a few weeks.

**Patient:** Will do. Thanks again. Goodbye.

**Doctor:** Goodbye.
