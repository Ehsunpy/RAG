CONVERSATION:

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Doctor. I've been better, to be honest. I've been having quite a tough time managing my pain and it's really affecting my mood.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. Let’s delve into it. Could you remind me which areas are most affected by the pain?

**Patient:** Sure, the pain is mainly in my lower back and knees. It's been constant for the past few months.

**Doctor:** I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain today?

**Patient:** Today it's about a 7. Some days it's worse, especially when I'm more active.

**Doctor:** And how is this affecting your daily activities? Are there things you’re unable to do because of the pain?

**Patient:** Absolutely. I struggle with walking for more than a few minutes and climbing stairs is really difficult. I'm also finding it hard to focus at work because of the pain.

**Doctor:** It sounds very challenging. Now, about your mental health, could you describe how your mood has been?

**Patient:** I've been feeling quite low and irritable. I get anxious easily and sometimes it feels like the pain is just too much to handle.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite?

**Patient:** Yes, my sleep is very disturbed. I wake up several times a night because of the pain. And my appetite is all over the place; some days I don’t feel like eating at all.

**Doctor:** It sounds like your chronic pain is significantly affecting your mental health. Let's talk about the medications you're currently taking. Could you list them for me?

**Patient:** Sure, I’m taking paracetamol and ibuprofen for the pain. I was also prescribed Amitriptyline to help with the pain and to aid sleep, but I'm not sure if it's helping.

**Doctor:** Thank you for that. How long have you been on Amitriptyline?

**Patient:** About three months now.

**Doctor:** And have you noticed any side effects from it?

**Patient:** I've been experiencing dry mouth and some dizziness, especially when I stand up quickly.

**Doctor:** Those can be side effects of Amitriptyline. Given your symptoms, it might be worth considering an adjustment in your medication. We'll discuss that in a bit. I’d like to perform a physical examination now, if that's alright with you.

**Patient:** Of course.

**Doctor:** I’ll start by examining your back and knees. Could you please stand up and try to bend forward slowly? Let me know if you experience any pain.

**Patient:** (Attempts to bend forward) Ouch, that's painful.

**Doctor:** Where does it hurt the most?

**Patient:** Mainly in the lower back.

**Doctor:** Thank you. Now, I’ll check your knees. Could you sit back down and I’ll test the range of motion in your knees? (Gently moves the knee) Let me know if you feel any discomfort.

**Patient:** Yes, there's a bit of pain there, especially on the right knee.

**Doctor:** Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Based on the physical examination and your symptoms, it seems like your musculoskeletal issues are quite pronounced and could be contributing to your overall mental health state.

**Patient:** Yes, it feels like everything is connected somehow.

**Doctor:** Exactly. Chronic pain often exacerbates mental health conditions like anxiety and depression, creating a cycle that's hard to break.

**Patient:** That makes sense. What can we do about it?

**Doctor:** First, let's address the pain. We could consider switching from Amitriptyline to another medication, like Duloxetine, which may help with both pain and mood. What do you think about that?

**Patient:** I'm open to trying that if you think it will help.

**Doctor:** Great. I'll prescribe Duloxetine and we’ll monitor how you respond to it over the next few weeks.

**Patient:** Okay, and what about my knee and back pain?

**Doctor:** For your musculoskeletal issues, I'd recommend starting with some physiotherapy. A physiotherapist can guide you through exercises that may help improve your range of motion and reduce pain.

**Patient:** That sounds helpful. How do I go about arranging that?

**Doctor:** I’ll refer you to a physiotherapist. Also, considering the chronic nature of your condition, we might benefit from creating a Mental Health Care Plan. This will allow you to access Medicare rebates for psychological services if you wish to see a psychologist.

**Patient:** Yes, I think talking to someone about managing my anxiety and mood could be beneficial.

**Doctor:** Excellent. I'll prepare the necessary paperwork for the Mental Health Care Plan. Now, let’s talk about billing. Given the complexity of your case, today’s consultation will fall under item 36, which covers a detailed consultation lasting over 20 minutes during normal hours. Additionally, the Mental Health Care Plan will be billed under item 2715.

**Patient:** Thank you for explaining that. I appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns.

**Doctor:** You're welcome. It's important that we tackle each aspect of your health together. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

**Patient:** Not right now. I’m hopeful that with these changes, things will start improving.

**Doctor:** I’m optimistic too. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to review your progress with the new medication and the physiotherapy.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good plan. Thank you, Doctor.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mrs. Thompson. Take care and we'll see you soon.
